            <p>The peach was sitting on the counter, its fuzz catching the light of the dying afternoon sun. It looked
                perfect, almost fake in its symmetry. But perfection is a warning, isn't it? Nothing real is that
                flawless without hiding something rotten at the core.</p>

            <p>I picked it up. It was warm, heavy with juice. My thumb pressed into the skin, just enough to leave a
                small indentation, a bruise before the bite. That’s how it always starts. verify the give before you
                commit to the take.</p>

            <p>They say the first bite is the sweetest, but they lie. The first bite is the most dangerous. It’s the
                point of no return. Once the skin is broken, the clock starts ticking on decay. The juice runs down your
                chin, sticky and sweet, and you can never un-taste it. You can never go back to the moment before you
                knew what it was like.</p>

            <p>I took the bite.</p>

            <p>It was sweeter than I imagined, floral and heady, filling my mouth with a taste that felt like summer
                memories I never actually had. But there was an edge to it, something sharp and almost metallic
                underneath the sugar. The savage part of the peach. The part that fights back against being consumed.
            </p>

            <p>I ate the whole thing, right down to the pit. The bitter, wrinkled stone that looks like a brain or a
                heart dried out in the sun. I held it in my hand for a long time, wondering if I should plant it. If I
                should try to grow something new from what I had destroyed. But I knew better. Some things are only
                meant to be consumed once, and then let go.</p>
