        <div class="story-content">
            
<p>Candice reclined in her office chair. She’d finished her work for the day, having squashed a particularly difficult-to-find bug in the company website. Now she was just playing with Master PC, as she had been doing every day for the last two weeks.</p>
<p>She was becoming a real Master PC power user. She brought her personal laptop to work and kept it open on her desk, occasionally opening people’s profiles and learning what made everyone tick. Whenever anyone asked about it, she told them to “IGNORE THAT LAPTOP” using the Command Voice. After that, it was like it wasn’t there.</p>
<p>Richard had started hitting the gym for an hour every morning before work, and Candice had continued to drop his weight and increase his muscle mass a little each day. Richard was amazed how much progress he was making, and how quick it was going. She had also dialed a few years off both of them. Not just superficial years this time, real biological years. It felt amazing being suddenly younger. She was also dropping her own weight a bit more. Getting that last ten pounds off and all.</p>
<p>Of course she could be learning a lot more if she would just change people. She was sure that’s how most people with Master PC did it. Get a harem and start making changes and see what all the sliders did by trial and error. But Candice had morals, she wasn’t going to go down that road. Her main goal right now was figuring out how to use Master PC to become independently wealthy, but there wasn’t anything obvious besides becoming a Scarlett Johansen lookalike and starting an OnlyFans. And, again, she didn’t want to use Master PC mainly for sex. Even if that was clearly its intended purpose.</p>
<p>She could probably force a wealthy person to just give her a lot of money, but she’d already seen many of them were protected somehow, and she didn’t want to draw any undue attention. So yesterday she’d mentioned to her boss’s boss that she would be a “GOOD CANDIDATE FOR PROMOTION.” Now she had a meeting next week with him to discuss her future at the company. Richard was doing well at his job too. He worked at a bank, doing some kind of financial analytics. His increased intelligence and self-confidence had been helping him get noticed. It was only a matter of time before he got a promotion as well, she figured.</p>
<p>She had bumped his self-confidence up a couple more times since that first day. She had just decided to keep doing it until she noticed a difference, and that had finally started happening in the last few days. He was now actually a bit more confident than average, but she wasn’t sure she liked it. He was definitely more take-charge now, and Candice was used to wearing the proverbial pants in the relationship. </p>
<p>He was also hitting on her more, but Candice didn’t mind that at all. They’d been doing it nearly every day since she’d found Master PC. She definitely got why people used it for sex. She’d never known it could be so good.</p>
<p>That was one of her problems. Every time they did it, she was thinking of Kevin. Every single fucking time. Her mind would wander back to that fitting room, and the best sex of her life. Objectively, he wasn’t that amazing. She had idly browsed Kevin’s profile a few times. Looking at him in Master PC, without the sex-goggles on, he wasn’t even that hot. Richard was better looking, especially with the tweaks Candice had made to him. But in her head, Kevin was basically the God of Sex, the male version of Aphrodite who had come down to earth and given Candice an experience she just couldn’t shake. She felt something building inside herself, a longing that made her worried she was going to do something stupid and cheat again.</p>
<p>She’d considered trying to erase her own memory of that event, but the docs warned against that heavily. Messing with your own memory was a recipe for disaster, it seemed. At least according to whoever had written the ReadMe files.</p>
<p>It was ironic that Master PC was created to make sex easy, but that was the one area she was actually struggling with. The entire reason she’d upped her sexuality in the first place was to make herself and Richard more sexually compatible. And sure, they were having sex more. But she had been keeping an eye on his “Sexual Attraction” numbers and his attraction to Candice had barely budged. In fact, his old girlfriend Nicole was the one going up! Candice knew for a fact he hadn’t had any contact with her, but he was definitely thinking about her the same way Candice was thinking about Kevin. </p>
<p>She made a decision. This couldn’t stand. With the god-like power of Master PC at her fingertips, this was something she could fix. And she knew the solution. She was going to turn her sexuality back up and fuck Richard. And she was going to temporarily turn Richard up at the same time. She was going to give him the night of his life, and after that they’d only think about each other.</p>
<p>OK, she thought, time to get to work. What does Nicole have that I don’t?</p>
<p>She pulled up all three of their profiles. Her own, Richard’s and Nicole’s, and began digging. An hour later, she had it. </p>
<p>Richard was rated at 112 Dominant on a scale of 0 to 180. It was another seemingly random scale of numbers, although really when it used percentages they weren’t much more helpful. She clicked on his “Dominant” slider to get more detail, and several check boxes populated next to it. “When aroused” was checked. Ahhh, so he was dominant in bed, and basically wanted a normal relationship otherwise. Well, that wasn’t so bad. It also explained all the mind control porn he’d been reading lately. Probably, turning up his sexuality had made him want to exercise that fantasy even more.</p>
<p>Comparatively, Candice’s Dominance was 43. Interestingly “When Aroused” wasn’t checked for herself. She just kind of liked to be in charge. Yeah, that tracked.</p>
<p>Nicole’s profile was more interesting. She had two little dots on the slider. One at Dominant 5, another at -93. When the negative dot was selected, the word “Dominance” changed to “Submission” and “when aroused” became checked. So Nicole was pretty middle-of-the-road normally, but submissive in bed. Interesting! And her submission matched Richard’s dominance pretty closely. </p>
<p>OK, Candice thought, now we’re cooking! Candice knew Nicole pretty well, they’d all been in the same friend group in college. She’d always seemed pretty normal, so if her dominance/submission was at -93, it was probably a safe number. Just to be sure, Candice checked around a few more people she knew. She found a couple people in the office with numbers slightly higher, which was reassuring.</p>
<p>Candice fired off a text to Richard. </p>
<div class="chat-container"><div class="chat-message msg-sent"><p>I hit my goal weight today! 🥳</p></div><div class="chat-message msg-received"><p>Really? You're still losing weight???</p></div><div class="chat-message msg-sent"><p>Not anymore! Down to my college weight, baby!</p></div><div class="chat-message msg-received"><p>Wow, congrats</p></div><div class="chat-message msg-sent"><p>We're going to celebrate tonight 💦</p></div><div class="chat-message msg-received"><p>We've been celebrating a lot lately 😆</p></div><div class="chat-message msg-sent"><p>Extra celebration tonight then. Anything you want tonight 😈</p></div><div class="chat-message msg-received"><p>Anything?</p></div><div class="chat-message msg-sent"><p>Anything.</p></div><div class="chat-message msg-received"><p>You're on!!!</p></div></div><p>The rest of the day crawled by. Candice’s mind kept going to what she was planning to do with Richard tonight. Thoughts of Kevin danced through her head, and for once she didn’t bat them away. After tonight, she assured herself, Richard would be the one she fantasized about. </p>
<p>When 3:00 hit, she was out the door. She had some experimenting to do, and it required privacy. </p>
<p>“Leaving early?” asked her boss.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Candice said, before adding, “IT’S FINE FOR ME TO LEAVE A LITTLE EARLY.” The harmonics of the Command Voice rippled through his brain and he just nodded and went back to work.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“OK, no fuckups this time,” she said aloud. She had her own profile pulled up. She had kept her dominance where it was, but she’d added a new dot on the Dominance/Submission slider. She’d set it to -20 and triple-checked that “When Aroused” was selected. </p>
<p>This was a little scary. She’d read several of the same stories Richard had, knew the tropes. Girls sapped of their free will, blindly obedient to their masters. She couldn’t risk that happening to herself, and she knew Master PC was more than capable of it if she messed something up like she had that first day.</p>
<p>Of course she’d found plenty of people with their submission at much higher numbers, usually when aroused. Logically it should be safe, but Candice wasn’t going to be stupid. She was starting slow. She clicked Apply.</p>
<p>Did she feel any different? Did she want to serve Richard as his personal servant? Nope, in fact the idea still vaguely repulsed her. She pulled up the erotic stories site again, and picked a story that, from his phone’s browser history, she knew he’d read several times. Cheap, by someone who went by Limerick.</p>
<p>She read the first few sections. It was about a couple named Jack and Kylie who were slowly being turned into sex maniacs by the local TV station. The story was well-written, but she didn’t really get the appeal. She turned up her submission a bit and kept reading. Halfway through and still nothing. She turned it up some more.</p>
<p>OK, now she was beginning to get a little turned on. Losing control like that could be pretty hot. And the amount of sex they were having was really appealing. As someone who had been pretty sexless up until a few weeks ago, she understood wanting to give into the changes. She increased her submissiveness a bit more. By the time Jack’s boss had been turned into a slut and was sucking his cock, Candice had her vibrator out and was cumming right along with the characters. </p>
<p>It was wild, she reflected, to edit her own sexual kinks and feel the ramifications in real time. Just as an experiment she dropped the submissiveness down again. And just like that, the story wasn’t sexy anymore. Then she turned her submissiveness into dominance. Now the story was hot again, but she was imagining herself as the people running the TV station, corrupting the town into a bunch of bimbos and himbos.</p>
<p>Neat, but not what she was after. That wouldn’t make her compatible with Richard. She set her submissiveness back down, settling on -90. It made the submission incredibly hot, even if she still wasn’t quite as submissive as Nicole. But this number would be safe, and safe was her watchword now.</p>
<p>OK, now time for step two. She needed to make sure her night with Richard made her forget Kevin. She went to her sexuality tab. The master Sexuality control was at 57%. Odd. She was sure she’d set it at 55% before. She knew no one else was messing with her either — she’d password protected herself a few days ago. She pulled up the ReadMe file. Master PC’s documentation was severely lacking in a lot of places, but the Sexuality files were the opposite. There was so much written, it was hard to process it all. </p>
<p>Sexuality is not a fixed number, she found deep in one of the text files. It is a live statistic indicating the target’s current overall sexuality. Some amount of natural variance is to be expected. Experiencing good sex can cause the subject to like sex more, thus increasing the number, though there are biological limits to natural increases. Traumatic sexual experiences, age, and hormone changes can have the opposite effect. To prevent this, right-click the control, and select “Lock”....</p>
<p>She stopped reading. She wasn’t interested in locking her sexuality into a certain number forever. At least she had an answer. She had been having a lot of good sex lately, and that made her want it more. It made sense. In fact, knowing that a number set in Master PC wasn’t necessarily forever made her a little more confident in her plan.</p>
<p>She set her Master Sexuality to 70%. She’d opened up a lot of people’s profiles. The high 60s were pretty much the province of horny teenage boys. Seventy would put her a hair above that, but still within the range of a normal human. She thought about 80% again, wanted 80% again, but knew it was too dangerous.</p>
<p>But she had a plan. Below the Master Sexuality setting was a plethora of sub-categories and controls. If the Master Sexuality slider was a sledgehammer, these were the screwdrivers and scalpels, able to make targeted changes. Candice was interested in hitting that same orgasmic high she’d experienced with Kevin without the danger of cheating on her husband. Below, she could change her “arousal curve.” She lowered it at the beginning, raised it at the end. She’d now ramp up to 80% levels, but slower, not turning into a slut from the feel of fabric on her nipples.</p>
<p>She increased her O-Index. There were actually a lot of sub-categories (sub-sub-categories?) below that, like O-Multiplier and O-Profundity. She stuck to the top-line number, copying over what she’d experienced at 80% to her new, less-horny 70% self. She gave her new statistics a careful double-check, and then a triple-check. It was all as safe as she could make it. She clicked “Apply” and felt the familiar shiver as the changes took effect. </p>
<p>Now for Richard. She turned him up as well. He had never experienced 80% before, so he didn’t really need to be as high, but Candice wanted to make sure he could satisfy her. She turned his Master Sexuality slider up to 65%, then dug into the sub-menus. As a guy, his settings were slightly different. She quickly found the one she was looking for and turned down his Refractory Period. There wasn’t really any guessing what was a safe number here, the documentation was pretty clear about how it worked. Even when it came to a magical computer program she was living in a world designed for men, Candice thought ruefully. She increased his penis size too. Kevin had been a little bigger than Richard, and she’d enjoyed it. She didn’t know if Richard would notice, but she figured she could use the Voice to make him think it was fine if he questioned it.</p>
<p>She clicked “Apply” again. Now she just had to wait for him to get home. She checked the clock, 4:45. She had thirty minutes to kill before he got home. </p>
<p>OK, a few more changes, she decided. She pulled her own profile back up and re-implemented most of the changes she’d made on the first day and then some. Candice shaped her eyebrows, removed every ounce of excess fat from her body, gave herself perfect skin, made her nose just a bit smaller, and increased her breast size, among a myriad of other small changes. She clicked “Apply” just as Richard arrived home.</p>
<p>She closed the laptop and rushed into the living room just as Richard walked in.</p>
<p>“Hey, you’re home!” she exclaimed, already excited for what she knew was about to happen. She tried to keep it light, easy, not giving away that just the sight of him set her pussy on fire. She’d turned down the initial side of her arousal curve, but the last hour of anticipation already had her very, very ready to go. Richard smiled back, and there was a definite gleam in his eye. </p>
<p>“I bought some wine…” Candice began, but Richard cut her off.</p>
<p>“God, Candice, you look amazing!” Candice looked down, and saw some definite movement in his pants as he looked her over.</p>
<p>“Well, you know, the clothes help too…” Candice did a kind of twirl, showing off the outfit she’d bought on the way home. It was a ruffled skirt and tank top, basically the same outfit she’d fucked Kevin in. As she finished her spin, Richard grabbed her and pulled her close. Her nipples were so hard now, just the pressure from squeezing against him set off fireworks. He reached down and tilted Candice’s head up and began to kiss her. She remembered, idly, how Richard had always been such a gentle lover up until two weeks ago. There was nothing gentle in this kiss, though. Just raw unbridled lust. She moaned as his tongue entered her mouth.</p>
<p>Then he broke the kiss, stared into her eyes, and said the words she’d been waiting to hear.</p>
<p>“We’re going out tonight,” he said</p>
<p>Wait, what?</p>
<p>“What?” she said out loud. “But, I… but…”</p>
<p>“You said anything I wanted, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” she said, the words tumbling out of her mouth. “Anything you want,” and Candice knew she meant them, the submissiveness kicking in. “I just thought you’d want to…. You know.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I do,” Richard replied with a smirk. “But it’s barely 5:30. I want to make a full evening of things. That’ll be the climax of the night, pun intended.”</p>
<p>Candice nodded. “Whatever you want. I said it, and I meant it. So where are we going?”</p>
<p>“Fox Theater, I made reservations after you sent the text.”</p>
<p>Fox Theater was the nicest place in town. It was an old movie theater from the 1920s. After sitting empty for almost 50 years, someone had finally bought it and turned it into a restaurant. There was an open kitchen underneath the screen, and they showed public-domain silent movies there while you ate. No one really watched the movie, it was more of an ambiance thing. But the theater was gorgeous on the inside, a big open space made of heavy beams and dark wood. </p>
<p>“OK,” Candice said, trying to gain control of her libido. “Let me find something nice to wear.” There was, of course, a dress code at Fox Theater.</p>
<p>“Way ahead of you,” Richard replied. “I’ve got tonight planned out. You still have that red dress you bought for Valentine’s Day when we were in college, right?”</p>
<p>“Uh… it’s at the back of my closet. But I haven’t been that thin in years. Plus, I’ve never worn it out in public. That was just a me and you thing.”</p>
<p>“Anything I want tonight, right?”</p>
<p>The gleam in his eye was so sexy. Richard didn’t usually just take charge like this, and Candice knew normally she’d be mad he was pushing this. But she wasn’t mad at him, she realized. Suddenly she was mad at herself for questioning it.</p>
<p>“Yes sir,” she said jokingly. But saying it felt so right. Goddam she was horny. She went to her closet, to the very back to find “The Dress” as she’d always thought of it. She had known she looked good in it when she bought it, but it was just too much to wear in public. She’d originally planned to wear it out on Valentine’s Day during sophomore year, but she’d chickened out and made sure they didn’t leave the bedroom that particular night. She’d put on weight after college, but always hoped she would fit into it again one day.</p>
<p>Today was that day. It was tight, with a low square neck and a very daring thigh-high slit. She fished it out from the recesses of her closet and stepped into the master bathroom to get ready. She pulled it on, feeling the fabric hugging every inch of her body. She avoided looking into the mirror while she struggled into it. Last time she’d tried to put it on, she’d been depressed for a week. Finally, after pressing out all the wrinkles, she got up her nerve and turned to face the mirror.</p>
<p>Holy shit! She looked just as good as she had all those years ago. No, better.</p>
<p>Candice had always been hourglass shaped. Wide hips, with a decent set of boobs. She’d always been pretty — maybe not the prettiest girl around, but Candice had always thought she was an easy 7 or 8, or at least she had been in her prime. But this new her? A perfect 10. </p>
<p>It wasn’t just her physique either, it was all the little changes she’d made with Master PC as well. Her hair was perfect and shiny, falling around her face in dark brown waves. Her face was young and blemish-free, more beautiful than it had ever been in ways she couldn’t quite place. Her stomach was flat, her legs toned with not even the slightest hint of cellulite to be seen. And then there were her boobs. She’d forgotten she’d turned them up a bit. They weren’t objectively huge, but on her newer, more slender body they looked a bit oversized. Candice was down to her college weight everywhere but her chest. The girls were as big as they’d ever been, and far perkier. They strained against the dress, looking like they wanted to escape, practically bursting over the neckline.</p>
<p>And she looked like this without even putting any makeup on! She didn’t need much, she realized. She looked like one of those TikTok girls who took an hour to achieve a “natural” look. A little bit of blush, some smokey eye, and dark red lipstick to match the dress and the look was complete. Maybe, she decided, she could still convince Richard to stay in for the night. </p>
<p>Richard was waiting when she stepped out of the bathroom. He was already dressed in a nice shirt and slacks. Guys had it so easy getting ready to go out. He froze when he saw Candice. Like, legitimately froze for a second, unable to grasp what he was seeing. Candice grinned and walked over to him with her sexiest walk.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you still want to go out?” she purred. She knew she was just oozing sex with this look. She was already turned on, and making herself more so. She wanted to kneel down in front of her husband, to submit to him, to let him use her however he wanted. She walked seductively towards him, swaying her hips from side to side.</p>
<p>It took a beat for him to respond. “Come on,” he said. “We don’t want to be late.”</p>
<p>Noooo! Her brain was screaming. How could he be saying no to fucking her right now? What was happening? But she didn’t let it show. She knew she couldn’t let her man down.</p>
<p>“OK,” she said, hiding her disappointment.</p>
<p>They took an Uber to the restaurant; they usually did on nights Richard wanted to drink. Candice caught the driver checking her out several times. Richard was making small talk, something about how great his day had gone at work. Candice didn’t really know much about finance at the best of times, and in her current state it was basically impossible to focus on the boring numbers he was talking about. Her mind kept wandering to more carnal subjects. Richard’s hand was on her thigh, his thumb making small circles where her dress slit exposed her skin. </p>
<p>“Candice? Did you hear me?” She snapped back to reality. What had he been saying? </p>
<p>“Huh? What?”</p>
<p>“We’re here,” he said. She realized he was getting out of the car. He stepped around and opened her door, a small act of chivalry she usually would not have appreciated. But tonight it made her swoon.</p>
<p>“Someone’s a bit ditzy tonight,” Richard chuckled. He took her by the arm and led her into the restaurant. Candice felt all eyes on her as they entered. Every guy, and several women, were stealing looks at her. She couldn’t blame them, she knew what she looked like. With each step she took, her toned leg was revealed through the slit in her dress, a flash of smooth skin that drew even more attention. Her breasts, still straining against the neckline of her dress, seemed to defy gravity, practically begging to be admired.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, the hostess led them to their seats, but just as they were about to sit down Richard indicated another table.</p>
<p>“Is that one free?” he asked. Fox Theater had two floors of seating. The main floor, and a higher half-floor of balcony seating. That’s where they were now. The balcony itself was a shallow U-shape, and Richard was pointing at the seat at the center, right next to the balcony railing. The hostess agreed and sat them down. </p>
<p>“Your server will be here momentarily,” she said. “In the meantime, can I get you started with some drinks?”</p>
<p>“I’ll have a Whisky Sour,” Richard said, “And a lemon martini for the lady.” The hostess left to fill their drinks as Candice squirmed in her seat.</p>
<p>“Why here?” Candice asked as she sat down. </p>
<p>“Did you see all those men checking you out in the lobby?” Richard asked.</p>
<p>“Uh… yeah,” Candice admitted.</p>
<p>“I wanted to let everyone enjoy the show.”</p>
<p>“But, everyone can see the movie.” Candice looked at the screen. It was some Charlie Chaplin film, but she didn’t know enough to identify it. </p>
<p>Richard laughed. “You really are a bit out of it today, hon. No, you’re the show. Look around. Every guy is stealing glances at you. Everyone sitting on the balcony with us, when they look at the screen, they see you. I bet a lot of guys are going to be pretending to watch the movie tonight. And look down. Everyone on the first level who looks up at the balcony, you’re the first thing they’re going to see. Right here, on display.”</p>
<p>“You… you like men looking at me?” she asked, confused.</p>
<p>Richard put his hand on hers. “Yeah. It’s always been a bit of a fantasy for me. The whole ‘trophy wife’ thing. To have a beautiful woman on your arm. To know that every man in the room wishes he was me. Seeing other men stare at you really turns me on, I don’t know why.” He paused, watching her face. “But if you’re not comfortable with it, we can…”</p>
<p>“No,” Candice interrupted him. “Anything you want tonight,” she said. It was becoming her mantra for the evening.</p>
<p>“And I have to admit, it is pretty hot, seeing everyone look at me like this. I mean, when I was in college sometimes I’d get a creepy guy staring at me, and I hated it. But tonight I feel like everyone’s eyes are on me, and it’s getting me so wet.” She put her hand to her mouth. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to be so vulgar. But I am, honey. I’m so fucking horny.” </p>
<p>“Honestly, I can tell. Just look at those nipples,” her husband replied. “I didn’t know they could get that hard.”</p>
<p>Candice looked down and gasped. “Oh my god, I’m not wearing a bra!“</p>
<p>Now Richard laughed out loud. “You didn’t know?”</p>
<p>“No! I was still trying to seduce you into not leaving the house when I got dressed! I forgot to put one on before we left! Oh Jesus, everyone can see me like a… a… a slut!” the word landed with a thud. A word she’d seen a lot lately reading the mind-control porn Richard liked. And as soon as she said it, she saw the gleam in his eye, knew he loved her saying that about herself.</p>
<p>“You look like you can’t wait until we get home.”</p>
<p>“I know, honey,” Candice said, almost whining. “I’m soooooo turned on I can’t stand it.”</p>
<p>“Then touch yourself,” he said.</p>
<p>“Are you suggesting that I touch myself right now?” Candice asked, a little shocked.</p>
<p>“No. I’m ordering you to. Anything I want.”</p>
<p>Candice’s hand shot down immediately, almost of its own volition. Even though she was on display for everyone to see here, center stage on the balcony, she was oddly afforded some small bit of privacy. A fancy white tablecloth was draped partially covering her lap, and the slit in the side of her dress provided easy access for her fingers. If no one was paying attention, she probably could have slid her fingers in without anyone noticing.</p>
<p>But people were looking.  That just made it all the hotter as she started rubbing her clit. Distantly, she realized she wasn’t wearing any panties either. Normally Candice would have been aghast at the idea she’d been so close to flashing everyone in the restaurant as she walked in, but that didn’t matter to her at all right now. A look of surprise crossed Richard’s face. He clearly hadn’t been expecting her to actually do it, but his expression immediately turned to one of lust as he said nothing, simply staring at Candice as her fingers played with the entrance to her pussy. </p>
<p>Their drinks arrived. Candice barely noticed as the server put them down on the table. “Are you ready to order or do you need… uh…. a moment?” The server trailed off uncertainly. Candice didn’t stop touching herself. Richard hadn’t told her to stop. The server couldn’t see anything explicit, her hand was under her dress, but it was obvious to anyone this close what she was doing. </p>
<p>“I’ll, uh, give you another minute,” he said and quickly retreated.</p>
<p>“Fuck, honey,” Richard said, “You’re really into this aren’t you?”</p>
<p>Candice nodded. “Whatever you want. That’s what I said. I’ve never been this… submissive… before,” she said, putting emphasis on the word, knowing he’d love hearing her say it. “But I love it. This is so hot. I’ve never been this turned on in my life.”</p>
<p>She began rubbing herself faster and faster. Her fingers circled her clit, picking up speed. Her nipples were so erect they felt like they were going to burst through her dress and she squirmed in her chair with the pleasure. With her free hand she reached up and brushed her nipples through the fabric. I’m losing control, she realized. She needed to end this now.</p>
<p>“Honey… tell me to cum,” she practically begged.</p>
<p>“Are you serious?”</p>
<p>“Please,” she whimpered.</p>
<p>Richard looked at her, at first still unsure. He didn’t say anything, just stared deep into her eyes, boring into her soul as she rubbed herself. Candice felt her fingers slick with her juices, waiting for the order from her husband, her man, her master. Finally, he came to a decision.</p>
<p>“Cum,” he commanded.</p>
<p>And she did. Her body started shaking, her free hand gripped the table, trying to hold herself upright. She wanted to close her eyes, but as long as Richard stared at her, she felt like she had to return the stare. Behind him, she saw the couple at the next table were watching. The man had a “Is this really happening?” expression on his face, the woman had a look of absolute disgust. </p>
<p>The thrill of knowing that this kind of exhibitionism was a turn-on for Richard made her cum even harder. She started to sway, started to feel an involuntary scream escape her lips. Richard saved her from the scream. He leaned across the table and kissed her deeply and she melted into it, shaking, finally beginning to come down from her orgasm. </p>
<p>He broke the kiss, and her libido at least partly sated, Candice got a bit of her senses back. “I need to clean myself up,” she said and quickly got up from the table. Before she left, she picked up the martini and downed it in one go. She needed it tonight.</p>
<p>As she made her way to the restroom, all eyes were on her.</p>
