        <div class="story-content">
            
<p>The glow of the computer screen bathed Candice in a gray light. It was well past midnight, and Richard was sound asleep in the bedroom. She could hear him snoring. It had been another uneventful evening. They’d watched some TV, had a frozen pizza dinner, and fallen asleep. And, Candice considered, that was sort of the problem. Candice was 29 years old — still in the prime of her life! She and Richard were a young couple. The magic couldn’t be gone already, could it?  </p>
<p>Richard had been a bit more distant lately, spending more and more time on his phone. That in itself wasn’t too bad, but she had seen him quickly lock the screen lately as she’d walked by, and she’d begun to get… not suspicious, exactly. More scared. Scared that she was going to lose him to some sort of online affair.   </p>
<p>So here she was at two in the morning, sitting in the dark office browsing this strangely monochromatic erotic story website. Candice knew a thing or two about computers — she was actually a software engineer by trade — so it had been easy to start tracking his phone use. That had led her here.  </p>
<p>It seemed Richard had read a lot of the stories on this website. He seemed to really like the ones that involved viruses that turned women into mindless bimbos and another series called Master PC, where the protagonist had a computer program that let you change people. They were kind of a “genie grants wishes” type of story wrapped up in a modern technological shell. Candice thought it was a kind of lazy plot device. Computer programs couldn’t do that. At least hypnosis had some grounding in reality.  </p>
<p>But she was curious about what Richard saw in them. Apparently he had a thing for mind control and submission that she’d never known about before. What else didn’t she know? She typed “Master PC” into her search bar to find more stories. Only one search result came up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’ve Been Selected. Install Master PC!\&lt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weird. She clicked the link to see what the site was about, and immediately a program unpacked onto her computer. Even weirder. Clicking links from search engines was not supposed to do that. It hadn’t even put her through an install wizard.   </p>
<p>An icon now sat on her desktop. The graphic was a simple stylized M. Master PC. She knew she shouldn’t click it. It could be a virus, spyware, or who knows what. But she was just too curious. She had to.  </p>
<p>The program launched and there it was, just like in all the stories. Candice saw herself from a third person view, as if a camera was about three feet to her right. Which, incidentally, would put it inside the wall. Beside her picture were her vitals. 5‘3” and 163 pounds. Long brown hair in a conservative haircut, though it was pretty messy this time of the night. There was an “athletics” entry that was at 40%, whatever that meant. Hovering over it revealed a multitude of sub-categories, from endurance to dexterity. Her sexuality was listed as well, as its own top-level statistic. It was only 30%. Hovering the cursor over that number revealed even more subcategories, from nipple sensitivity to the “Erogenous Shoulder Slider.” There were more statistics, but she skipped them.  </p>
<p>As she looked closer, it wasn’t exactly like all the stories. Admittedly, Master PC was always a little bit different depending on who was writing, but the characters in the stories always seemed to have the ability to type whatever they wanted in. Candice looked all around for a box where she could type “Candice looks like a young Heidi Klum, but prettier and wins the lottery every time she plays.” This box was nowhere to be found.  </p>
<p>In its place were a dizzying array of drop-down menus, sliders, and text boxes filled with numbers and percentages. A window called “Mental State” flashed an ever-changing array of icons that made no sense to Candice, even though she already knew what she was thinking. Candice browsed a bit until she found the “superficial appearance” tab. That seemed like a safe place to experiment. She adjusted the “master weight” slider down thirty pounds, and watched them drop off the on-screen avatar. She hovered the mouse over “Apply Changes,” held her breath, and clicked.  </p>
<p>A shiver ran over her body, and instantly she felt lighter. Candice had been heavier and lighter over the years as she’d dieted, achieved her goals, and then gotten lazy and fallen off the wagon. One thing she’d never noticed was the difference she felt as she slowly packed on or lost weight, but now Candice immediately felt better as the pounds evaporated. She sat in shock, staring at the screen, at herself, and back again. It was real. My God, it was real.  </p>
<p>What should she do? Should she go wake up Richard? Should she just delete the program and forget about it? Should she call the news? She stared at the screen for five minutes, before realizing there was really only one choice. Anyone given this kind of power would have to use it. It was just too tempting… and she could show Richard later, once she had figured out how it worked. She made more adjustments. She was happy with her breasts, but they’d begun to sag just a bit. Richard had said it was just her imagination when she’d mentioned it to him, but she could tell. It couldn’t hurt to make them perkier, so she found that dial under the “breasts” subcategory and adjusted it up to where she’d been in high school… maybe even a bit better. She found the “apparent age” slider, and adjusted it down to 21. A warning flashed, saying she should be careful when using the “apparent age” slider in conjunction with the “biological age” slider. She made a mental note to find that option later.  </p>
<p>Then she really got into it, shaping her eyebrows, lengthening her eyelashes, slightly plumping her lips, and making her nails longer and stronger. She made her hair a darker chocolate brown and gave it the lustrous sheen that only models on the boxes of hair-care products have. Then she took some more weight off just for fun. There was another slider for “facial symmetry.” She moved that down, and her features distorted grotesquely. Then she slid it up to 100%. Her features returned to normal. In fact, better than normal. She couldn’t tell exactly what was different about her face… but it was just overall more attractive.  </p>
<p>In the end, the avatar in front of her was like a much, much prettier version of herself. It was still herself, still Candice, but a version of herself that had just spent hours at an all-inclusive spa and was having a great make-up and hair day. She hit “Apply” and ran over to the mirror. A gorgeous woman stared back at her.  </p>
<p>Going back to the computer, she typed Richard’s name and began browsing his vitals. Again, jumping to “Superficial Appearance,” she brought his weight down a bit. He wasn’t as far off his college weight as Candice, but he had gained a bit. She turned it down just enough that she didn’t think he’d notice and upped his “facial symmetry,” which did wonders for him as well in ways she couldn’t quite pinpoint. She stopped there, not wanting to do anything too drastic that he’d notice. She clicked “Apply.”  </p>
<p>Taking a breath, she realized she was doing exactly what all the characters in the Master PC stories always did. She chided herself. With this kind of power, you needed to use it on more important things than breast perkiness. She went into Richard’s health tab. He always complained about his back. Numbers representing muscle strength and resilience, bone density and white cell production… it was all there. And a lot more complicated than “superficial appearance.” Candice got the impression she’d need to be a doctor to really comprehend most of it. Nevertheless, she managed to make some tweaks that she thought would help.   </p>
<p>And if she could do something like that.... what about her grandparents? They were in pretty poor health. Could she make them healthier? Make them in better shape and more mobile for the rest of their lives? Make them younger altogether? What about people she didn’t know? Should she be curing kids with cancer? Something else from the Master PC stories surfaced in her mind. Some of them talked about a sort of “shadow police,” making sure people like Candice didn’t cause problems. They were just stories… but obviously she wasn’t the only person with Master PC. And she hadn’t heard of any cancer wards suddenly being completely cured. She’d have to take this slow. Think about it. Still, she pulled up her grandparents’ and dialed their biological age (she’d found that setting on the health tab) back three years. There. Now, she had some time to figure out exactly what to do for them. She resolved to come back to the Big Questions later. For now, she was going to do some safe stuff no one would notice.  </p>
<p>The “mental” tab caught her eye. She pulled Richard back up, and with a voyeuristic thrill checked him out. Under Romantic Love, there was a drop-down box. Candice’s name, along with a few other women, were listed there. Most of them were his ex-girlfriends. She was shocked, until she began browsing through it. For some reason, it rated love on a scale of 1 to 512. His love for her was in the mid 400s. No other woman got out of the 30s. She thought about turning herself up all the way to 512, but resisted. She knew she’d regret making him love her on anything but his own terms. But under Sexual Attraction, she was nearly heartbroken to find that she rated lower than several of those same ex-girlfriends. Was this the source of his distance? Candice had never considered sex to be the main component of a relationship, but she’d always heard guys were different that way.  </p>
<p>In the next room, she heard the shower turn off. She hadn’t even realized it had been turned on. She looked at the time. Richard was up and getting ready for work! Panic struck her. She slammed the laptop shut and wondered if he’d notice the changes. Would they be too much to explain away? She jumped into bed, pulling the covers over her.  </p>
<p>Richard stepped out of the shower. “Hey, hon. Back in bed?”  </p>
<p>“Yeah.... I’m not feeling good. I’m going to call into work,” she replied, her face muffled in the pillow.  </p>
<p>“Anything I can do? Want me to grab some medicine or something?”  </p>
<p>“No, I was just up taking some Tylenol when you got in the shower.”  </p>
<p>They made a bit more small talk before Richard left, Candice being careful to hide her body under the covers. Richard left for work, and Candice called in sick, then immediately jumped back onto the computer.  </p>
<p>She pulled up her own profile. She looked back at the bar labeled “30% sexual”. She hadn’t made any psychological changes to herself yet, and this seemed like a good place to experiment. Besides, it would probably make their relationship stronger. She turned it up to 80% and clicked “Apply.” She felt the same shiver, and immediately, thinking back on Richard, she realized she should have done this before he left so they could have had a morning quickie before he left… and then she smiled. It worked! But she didn’t feel like a sexual zombie. She just felt more, well, sexual. And she enjoyed sex as much as the next person. More couldn’t really be bad, right?  </p>
<p>She decided she’d made enough changes for now. She got up, got a shower, and pulled on some clothes. They were a bit too big for her new, more slender frame. She hadn’t been this thin since high school. Maybe not even then.</p>
<p>Candice looked and felt better than she had in years, and it made her want to get out of the apartment. Part of her also felt like she was in some kind of fever dream. Like having Master PC couldn’t possibly be real. Somehow, getting out into the world felt like it would prove something to herself. Would guys be checking her out again, like they had when she was younger? She had to know. </p>
<p>Candice grabbed her purse and headed out to the mall. It was deserted, like all malls were these days. She started to go into Lane Bryant, but something stopped her. Across the way was an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. She hadn’t shopped there in years, but hell, she figured she’d get something cute. The store had just opened and was pretty quiet. There was only one other shopper, a young girl who looked like she was skipping classes. Two salespeople stalked the floor, on the lookout for commission. One was already helping the other shopper. The other, a slightly scruffy hunk that looked like he should be a model, lounged by the sales counter. Candice idly wondered what it’d be like to fuck his brains out with her new and improved body, then mentally scolded herself. She browsed for a bit, and picked out a ruffled mini-skirt and a cute tank top similar to what she’d seen a lot of college kids wearing lately. She’d wanted to wear something like this for a while, but hadn’t had the figure until today.  </p>
<p>“You want to try that on?” Candice turned to see the hunk, whose name tag said “Kevin,” standing behind her. “I can open the changing rooms if you want.” She was momentarily breathless, up close he was even more handsome, in that slightly scruffy surfer kind of way. He wore a slim-fit tee and sported a dark tan. Candice imagined he must have six-pack abs. Involuntarily, her eyes were drawn down to his crotch. His shorts were loose fitting, but from what she could tell, it was a pretty good size. She imagined him ramming it into her on the beach.  </p>
<p>“You OK?” he asked. Candice shook her head, clearing her thoughts.  </p>
<p>“I’m fine. Yeah, I’d like to try this on.” She followed him back to the changing room, out of sorts. Something was wrong. She looked at him again, critically. Yes, he was handsome. Yes, he was fit. But he was no model. She shouldn’t be this way — it must be Master PC. She must have turned her sexuality up too much. She would have to get home and turn it down. She resolved to buy the clothes, head straight home, and fix it.  </p>
<p>He’d opened the changing room for her, so she stepped in and tried on the outfit. The mini was short and flirty, showing off her legs. The top stretched across her chest. She could see her bra straps, though, and they didn’t match the top at all, so she took the tank off, discarded her bra, and tried it on again. Thanks to Master PC, she didn’t really need a bra anyway. Her breasts were perky under the fabric, and that wasn’t all. Now clearly visible, her nipples were erect like little tent poles. She reached up and touched one, and an electric shock went through her body. She felt something run down her thigh, and realized how wet she was. Her panties were soaked. She pulled them off, and set them with her bra. If her nipples had felt that good… she reached down and slid a finger in. She wasn’t ready for what she felt next. Pure pleasure coursed through her body. She lost her footing, and landed on the changing room’s bench.   </p>
<p>“Are you OK in there?” she heard Kevin ask. Candice managed a grunt in the affirmative. She was too busy exploring her pussy. She was so turned on… thoughts of Richard fucking her with her new mini bunched up around her waist flashed through her mind as she fingered herself with one hand, the other stroking a nipple through her top. She thought of Kevin, the Greek God of Abercrombie and Fitch, as he fucked her mouth from the other side, his cock filling her throat. Then she came, as hard as she ever had in her life, her juices making a puddle on the bench. She tried to stay quiet, but she couldn’t help but moan as the waves of pleasure shot through her.  </p>
<p>“Miss? Did you hear me? Are you alright?” She realized he’d only heard her fall and moan afterward. It was so nice for him to be concerned about her. She should reward him, she thought. </p>
<p>“I’d be better with you in here,” she said, opening the door.</p>
<p>Kevin stared in shock for a moment. Candice was embarrassed and turned on at the same time, knowing what she must look like to him: some slut with hard nipples and a soaking pussy inviting him into the changing room. But clearly, Kevin decided that chances like this don’t come along very often. He looked down the hallway to make sure no one saw and stepped in, locking the door behind him. Candice pulled him against her body. Her mini was, as in her fantasy, bunched up around her waist. As her breasts pressed against him, her nipples screamed pleasure into her brain, even with the fabric of her top between them. Kevin immediately began kissing her deeply, his tongue playing with hers as his hand found her wet pussy. He slid his finger in, and she felt her muscles clamp around it, hungry for something to be inside her. They broke their passionate kiss, and stared into each other’s eyes for a moment that seemed to go on forever.   </p>
<p>“Fuck me,” she said.  </p>
<p>Kevin nodded. She helped him pull off his tee, and then bent down, taking his pants off. His erect cock sprang into her face. It was bigger than Richard’s - it must have been seven inches long. She’d never been a very oral person, but his cock was so beautiful it made her mouth water. She tentatively kissed the head. He moaned encouragement, so she took it deeper, her lips wrapping around the shaft. She flicked her tongue around the head, and he moaned again. She felt him grab her hair as he began to pump it in and out of her mouth, and she simply lost herself in the moment. Kneeling there in front of him, one hand on his cock, guiding it as he fucked her mouth, the other fingering her clit, Candice was in heaven. He reached down with a free hand and grabbed one of her tits, pinching her nipple. Candice didn’t really like having her nipples pinched, but despite the pain, the pleasure was unbearable, and she immediately started to cum, moaning around his cock. She felt him tense, ready for his cum… and then he stopped, pulling out. What was wrong? She looked up at him, desperate for more. Apparently, he misunderstood the look.   </p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” Kevin said, “I’m going to do more than just that.” More? All she could do was whimper. He spun her around, and she felt his erection, wet with her spit against her ass. She bent over, propping herself up on the changing room bench, exposing her dripping pussy to him. He was bigger than she was comfortable with, but with the amount of lubrication she was producing, he slid in quickly. His cock filled her up, and even though from somewhere in her mind a tiny voice screamed at her for cheating on Richard, mostly all she could do was think that this was the best fuck she’d ever had in her life.   </p>
<p>“Oh God, Kevin. Oh, God..... fuuuuuck meeeee....” she didn’t care if anyone heard her. She would have shouted it if she could, but she felt like all her energy was going into the fucking. Kevin pounded her mercilessly. In, out. In, out. It was perfect. Her tits swung free in rhythm with his thrusts and her nipples were so sensitive even the air brushing against them felt amazing. She started to cum again, her pussy massaging his cock. She heard Kevin groan, felt him tense.   </p>
<p>“Yes, please, Kevin! Cum in me.... please....” She felt the first hot spurts of his jism inside her and her pussy went wild, the muscles undulating, as if trying to milk him of all his semen… “Yes! Cum in meeeeee!” she kept screaming as he shot his load into her, in this perfect moment of pure sex.   </p>
<p>How long did they stay like that after it was over, her pussy twitching around his cock? Candice wasn’t sure, it must have been just a few seconds. It felt longer. Finally, Kevin pulled out, his cock coated with juices.  </p>
<p>“That was amazing,” he said. “Um… can I get your number?”  </p>
<p>Candice didn’t know what to do. Her libido satiated, she was coming back to her senses, and the realization that she’d just cheated on Richard hit her like a ton of bricks. She didn’t know what to say. She quickly gave Kevin a fake number, ran out of the store, and jumped in the car. Her tires screeched as she tore out of the parking lot on the way home. She knew one thing. She had to change herself back before something like this happened again!</p>
