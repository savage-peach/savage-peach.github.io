        <div class="story-content">
            
<p>It was official: Candice was a slut.</p>
<p>One thing she liked about Master PC was that it boiled everything down to a number. Couples might have cute little arguments. “I love you more.” “No, I love you more.”</p>
<p>But if you had Master PC, you knew. Richard loved Candice four points more than she loved him. It was right there. By the same logic, Candice was a slut. Sluttiness was one of the major sexual controls, right under the Master Sexuality slider. She was pretty sure her number was zero yesterday, but today she was 58-points slutty, whatever that meant. </p>
<p>So she was a slut now. She let the idea roll around in her head. She didn’t hate it.</p>
<p>Candice was pretty sure she knew what had happened. When Richard had been fucking her at the restaurant, she’d felt the Command Voice come out when she’d screamed “I’M A SLUT!” into the mirror. Normally the Voice didn’t affect the person using it. She’d said “IGNORE THAT LAPTOP” plenty of times at work and she could still see it fine. But looking at herself in the mirror, she had directed the Voice back onto herself.</p>
<p>She wondered, not for the first time, how “sticky” changes made with Master PC were. Take something non-sexual like rollercoasters, for example. Imagine someone was scared of them, but Master PC had a “loves rollercoasters” slider. If you set that up high and stuck them on a rollercoaster they’d have a ton of fun. What would happen if you set that number back down later? They would still have fond memories of riding the rollercoaster, and might want to get on it again. Would they enjoy it because they’d already had fun on it once, and wouldn’t be scared of it anymore?</p>
<p>By the same token, Candice’s exhibitionism was pretty high now, according to Master PC. Was that because she’d done it last night when she wanted to please Richard, and now it was just something that turned her on in general because it had been fun once? Or possibly she’d always had some latent exhibitionism that had never manifested when she was 30% sexual. </p>
<p>So many questions.</p>
<p>Candice pondered them as she sat curled up on the couch with her morning tea and her laptop open. It was late Saturday morning, the day after her wild night of submission, and she was still figuring out what to do next. No matter what she decided, she knew her life was changed forever.</p>
<p>Richard was in the building’s gym downstairs. He’d kissed her when they’d woken up, ready for another round. She’d turned him down. It had been hard, but she’d had to prove to herself that she could. It turned out she’d set her arousal curve correctly. She could hit an incredibly orgasmic high (“Kevin who?” she joked to herself) with a much slower buildup. But yesterday she’d spent the hour before Richard got home masturbating to mind control porn and anticipating what they were going to do together. Of course she’d been ready to go when she saw him. </p>
<p>In fact, in many ways last night had gone perfectly. Her plan had worked, despite the curveball of Richard taking her out to eat. They’d had amazing sex, and she’d been the perfect little submissive slut for her husband, fulfilling his long-held fantasy. And yet, here she was this morning, not feeling particularly submissive at all. The magic of “when aroused” in Master PC was working fine. Candice congratulated herself on her accomplishment. She really felt like she was beginning to understand how to use Master PC. </p>
<p>And with her newfound confidence, she was rethinking the second part of her plan. She had been going to reset herself and Richard back to 55%, but could they just stay at this heightened sexuality permanently? Candice had to admit, last night was fun, and the orgasms were almost addictively mind-blowing. </p>
<p>This morning, before Richard had left for the gym, when he was still horny and ready to go, she’d asked him if he had really meant what he’d said last night, that he wanted her as a strong independent woman. He’d said yes, and she knew he was telling the truth because she’d been watching the icons flashing on his mental state readout. She had gotten pretty good at reading them.</p>
<p>It opened up a whole new world of possibilities. If he’d lied then, or changed his mind, she’d have reverted herself right then and there. Maybe even dropped his dominance. The submission was terrifying in a way. Last night, if he’d told her to change herself permanently, she knew she would have done it. But now she knew she could explore this submission as much as she wanted. Even at her most submissive, she wouldn’t change herself into a bimbo permanently because it wasn’t what he really wanted.</p>
<p>Perhaps, thought Candice, she could use the weekend to experiment and figure out where she wanted to leave their settings on a long-term basis. She had to prove one more thing to herself first, though. She turned her Sluttiness down to 0 and clicked Apply.</p>
<p>Suddenly, deep shame washed over her. She felt aghast at how she’d been kicked out of a fancy restaurant, how far she’d let Richard take it. It wasn’t pleasant, but she forced herself to examine her feelings. Did she want to turn it back up?</p>
<p>It was like the rollercoaster example. If she hated rollercoasters, and turned up her love of them so she could ride them with Richard, that wouldn’t be bad. Was sex or sluttiness any different, ethically? It felt like it was, somehow, but she couldn’t put a finger on why. She was making these changes to herself, of her own free will. There was nothing wrong with that. And nothing wrong with being a slut, either, she told herself. She’d always said women shouldn’t slut-shame each other. That went double, she figured, for slut-shaming herself. Plus, despite feeling a little disgusted at herself for kneeling before her man last night, it had also been one of the best experiences of her life. </p>
<p>She turned her sluttiness back up to 58. No, she thought, let’s make it a nice round 60. Just to prove to herself it was her own choice. She clicked Apply.</p>
<p>The shame vanished, replaced with arousal, and an anticipation of doing it again. It felt right. She was a slut now, after all. Or at least this version of her was, and this was the version she’d made herself into.</p>
<p>Speaking of sluts, something in Master PC caught her eye. Candice still had Richard’s profile pulled up as well, and had been keeping an eye on him at the gym. Now a girl was approaching him. Candice didn’t normally spy on Richard this much, but she wanted to make sure he could stay loyal to her even at 65%. The only thing Candice had changed about him since last night was increasing his refractory period to something more normal. It was still a lot shorter than most guys, but she knew if Richard was getting hard every hour he’d figure out something weird was going on pretty quick.</p>
<p>The girl was young and pretty, with dirty blonde hair and a decent pair of tits. Candice turned on the sound. </p>
<p>When she’d first started using Master PC, it had just shown a person’s naked avatar in a white empty space. But of course Master PC had a seemingly infinite number of controls and options. She’d figured out how to switch to a camera view last week. Now she saw the full gym, heard the sound of weights being lifted through the laptop speakers. It was like a third-person view in a videogame. The “camera” was locked on Richard, but she could spin it around and see what was happening nearby.</p>
<p>The girl was asking him for help with some of the gym equipment. She was wearing tight yoga pants and a sports bra with nothing over it. Candice made a note to buy an outfit like that for herself. </p>
<p>“Move along,” Candice said out loud to the girl on screen, but didn’t actually make any changes. She wanted to see how this played out. Richard did help her with the equipment, showing her how to use one of the arm exercise machines. The girl began chatting him up. Candice didn’t need Master PC to know she was attracted to Richard. She kept touching her hair occasionally, laughing at what he said even when it wasn’t a joke. </p>
<p>Candice double-clicked on her, shifting Master PC’s focus. Candice saw her name appear on the screen overlay. It was one of those godawful misspellings, Paezleigh. And she was only 19! Richard was more than 12 years her senior! Come on girl, Candice thought, I know you see the wedding ring.</p>
<p>Finally, she offered her number to Richard. Candice held her breath, watching intently. He said no! Candice pumped her fist in the air. Suck it, Paezleigh! Well, actually, you can’t. I’m going to be the one sucking it today!</p>
<p>She watched as Richard got up and went to the bathroom. And was he? Yes. He was masturbating in the stall. Candice watched with a voyeuristic thrill. Suddenly, she wished she was there with him, ready to satisfy his urges. She pressed her legs together tightly, loving the pressure it put on her clit. </p>
<p>If this weekend was going to be experimenting with Master PC, Candice thought, she should get started while Richard was gone. She felt like she’d made enough psychological changes to herself for now, but a few more physical ones could be fun.</p>
<p>First things first, time to go blonde. She pulled up the hair colors and browsed through all the different shades of fair hair that Master PC offered. She first tried some of the lighter shades, but she just couldn’t see herself as a Platinum Blonde. In the end, she settled on Light Blonde, retaining some of the lowlights of her own darker hair color. She liked the way the blonde hair looked on her, it definitely added to the “light, flirty” look a slut like her should be going for. She debated heavily about leaving her eyebrows dark. On one hand, leaving her eyebrows dark gave her a “bottle blonde” look that definitely fit, but she really dug the natural look of “blonde everywhere” too. In the end she split the difference and brightened her eyebrows up a few shades while leaving them a bit darker than her hair.</p>
<p>Now she needed to do something about her body hair. Normally she kept a trimmed bush. Shaving every day was a lot of work, and Richard complained about the stubble if she let it go. She could make the carpet match the drapes, but of course “no body hair” was a very prominent checkbox for Master PC. She checked it.</p>
<p>On to clothes. There actually was a clothing tab. That had surprised Candice at first. Everything else in Master PC was about changing a person, not a thing. You could use it to alter a person’s weight, sexual orientation, ethnicity, almost anything. But you couldn’t change the color of your couch or the size of your coffee mug.</p>
<p>But it made sense once you realized Master PC was made for sex, and part of the “instant bimbo” fantasy had to include clothing. So of course it was there. Weirdly enough, nearly all the clothes it had pre-loaded were wildly out of fashion. Most of the clothing selections looked like something from the 90s or early 2000s. The lingerie was especially lacy and frilly and had an outsized selection of stockings and garter belts.</p>
<p>Of course, Master PC offered unlimited customization. If Candice was any good at 3D Modeling, she could have made herself just about any outfit imaginable. But honestly that sounded like more work than just shopping. The big use she saw for the clothing in Master PC was that she could resize her wardrobe. At least anything Candice ordered online could always be fitted perfectly. </p>
<p>Candice decided to google “Slut” to get some outfit inspirations. The top result caught her eye. It was just the definition.</p>
<p>&gt; slut (n) a woman who has many casual sexual partners.</p>
<p>Candice chuckled. It was funny, before Master PC she’d only ever had two sexual partners: an old high school boyfriend and Richard. Then a couple weeks ago, she’d fucked Kevin, the Abercrombie &amp; Fitch sales associate. But at that point she’d been under the influence of Master PC, so he hardly counted. But even including him, she’d still only slept with three men ever. She must be one of the least promiscuous sluts alive, she thought.</p>
<p>OK, back to looking for outfit inspiration. She clicked over to the image results and found mostly porn. She changed her search to “slutty outfits” and saw a plethora of sexy and revealing clothes. Candice knew she wouldn’t be able to get many of those outfits in the local clothing boutiques, so she ordered at least a dozen great outfits online. With Master PC, she was sure she could make them fit perfectly.</p>
<p>But she still needed something to wear today. She got up and put on the skirt she’d been planning to wear last night, before Richard had made her change into the dress. After it appeared on her avatar, she grabbed the resizing tool and made it a few inches shorter. She didn’t have a great top to go with it, but tube tops never went out of style, so she found one of those in Master PC. The default color was a super saturated Barbie-pink. She changed it to a pure white, and then changed the color on the skirt to match. She gave herself a pair of white platform heels to complete the look. She clicked Apply.</p>
<p>She watched as her skirt shortened and her t-shirt morphed, shrinking and changing color. She hadn’t been wearing any shoes, but her socks morphed into the heels, becoming hard plastic. It was very cool to watch, like some kind of movie special effect. </p>
<p>One more change, she decided. She had been cautious with Master PC ever since that first day, but considering how well things had gone last night, she had the confidence to try a few more of the outrageous things that had caught her eye. She went back to the Secondary Control options. The Command Voice had been one of the most useful things she’d used so far, there had to be some more stuff in there. She scrolled through the other options. Animal Magnetism? Didn’t need it, her current looks did that for her already. Commanding Presence? Interesting thought, but it didn’t fit with the submissive slutty vibe she had going. Vampirism? Why would you even want that? You could get the mind control and eternal youth from Master PC without the downsides. </p>
<p>There was a whole section called “Fluids” that had a ton of options. She could give herself permanently lactating breasts, and make either that milk or her pussy juices have any kind of hypnotic, mind-controlling, or body-altering effects. She didn’t want any of that, but an option under saliva caught her eye. She could make any man instantly hard by sucking on his cock. That was perfect. She could keep Richard’s refractory period normal, but use this power to get him up again if he finished before she was done. She selected that. </p>
<p>Speaking of which, she could also make his cum taste good. She thought about that, but wondered if he would notice. Would it change the smell if he masturbated? Better not, when she could just make herself enjoy the taste. Same difference, really.</p>
<p>But she was really looking for something more utilitarian. Something like the Command Voice that was useful outside of sex. Then she found an interesting option: Mind Reading. That looked neat. She could imagine all sorts of possibilities there. She turned it on and clicked Apply again.</p>
<p>That should do it for changes, she decided. Candice walked over to the mirror and admired herself. In some ways she looked much as she had last night at the restaurant. She still had flawless skin, a great ass, and a killer rack. But last night, with her dark brown hair and sexy but stylish dress, she’d looked like an expensive escort or a celebrity on the red carpet. Now she looked… kind of trashy. The blonde hair, the tube top. It was definitely a look. A slutty look. Candice liked it.</p>
<p>As she admired herself, she noticed how her tits almost seemed to defy gravity. Did they look fake, like she’d had a boob job? Or were they passable as natural? And, now that she thought of it, when had she started to think of them as tits? Candice had always called them breasts, or maybe “boobs” if she was feeling sexy. They’d never been tits to her before. It must be the sluttiness, she thought.</p>
<p>Just looking at herself in the mirror turned her on. She imagined herself kneeling before Richard as her new blonde self, dressed like a trashy slut. It made her wet just thinking about it.</p>
<p>She wanted to do it now, wanted to text him to come up right away and let her suck his cock. But no. She needed time to make him think she’d dyed her hair. She needed to leave the apartment for a while and come back later. Which was fine, she needed to do some more clothes shopping for her new figure. But she just wanted him so bad right now.</p>
<p>She probably shouldn’t go out like this, she reasoned. She had felt like she was in control of her libido all morning, but watching Richard masturbate, and then making the changes to herself had really made her horny again. It wasn’t too bad — she wasn’t in danger of “doing a Kevin” right now, but better safe than sorry. </p>
<p>She headed to her bedroom and pulled her vibrator out of the nightstand. Before last night it hadn’t been used in several months, but Candice felt like it was going to be used a lot more in the future. She reclined on the bed and turned it on. </p>
<p>As the vibrations hummed against her clit, Candice closed her eyes and let her mind wander. The pleasure built, a warm wave spreading through her. She imagined Richard, strong and commanding, looking down at her, her new blonde hair spread around her head like a halo. She saw herself on her knees, eager to please him, to fulfill his every desire. The thought of being completely his, a submissive slut at his beck and call, sent shivers of excitement through her.</p>
<p>“Yes, Daddy,” she whispered to herself, the word feeling surprisingly natural on her lips. It was what Richard had asked to be called last night. Old Candice used to cringe when she heard women call their man “Daddy.” She had thought it was some kind of incestuous fetish, gross and wrong. But now she understood. It wasn’t about family; it was about power. About submission. About being a little girl who didn’t make decisions on her own and who was completely at the mercy of the man who commanded her. It made her feel small and vulnerable, and she loved it.</p>
<p>She imagined him calling her “good girl,” his voice deep and approving. She wanted to be Daddy’s good girl, to serve him, to make him proud of her transformation. The vibrator pressed harder, mirroring the intensity of her growing fantasy. She moaned softly, a delicious tension building in her core as she pressed the vibrator against her clit. She was ready. Ready for Daddy.</p>
<p>A little part of the old her recoiled. She couldn’t do this. It was one thing to play at being submissive with Richard. It was another thing to make him her Daddy. But the voice was small, and drowned out as her orgasm crested, a gentle shiver rippling through her body, a small, teasing release that left her aching for a deeper, more profound surrender. It was enough to whet her appetite, to remind her of the incredible pleasure she was capable of, but not enough to truly satisfy the craving that now consumed her. She needed Richard, needed her Daddy, to fully claim her.</p>
<p>There was one more thing her Daddy wanted that he’d mentioned last night. One more thing she’d been avoiding. She pushed the vibrator inside her, leaving it on the lowest setting. A gentle buzz that left her perpetually near the edge.</p>
<p>She grabbed the laptop and browsed back through Master PC. She couldn’t find exactly what she wanted at first. There was, of course, an option for “bimbofication” but it included body changes, and she’d done enough of that for now. She dove into the documentation. And after a few text searches found what she was looking for.</p>
<p>Temporary Sex-related intelligence drain is surprisingly difficult for such a common fantasy. There is no default option for this in Master PC. The closest option is to use Arousal-Induced Bimbofication with the associated physical changes disabled. However, bimbofication includes an increase in sexuality, and if the woman in question has already had her sexuality increased this may not be desirable. There is no single control for simple ‘dumbification.’</p>
<p>However, I have developed the following method. First, browse to the Mental tab…</p>
<p>Candice was beginning to develop the theory that the documentation was written not by the creator of Master PC, but by users who had written out their findings before passing the program on to someone else. Now she was benefiting from their wisdom — not to change another woman against her will, as the author had undoubtedly intended, but to change herself.</p>
<p>She followed the instructions as written to the best of her ability. She set new values for many of her intelligence-related traits, but instead of clicking Apply immediately, she right-clicked the new value and tied it to a floating O-Satiation variable defined on the sexuality tab. The vibrator buzzing away inside her made it more difficult, but she also knew she wouldn’t have the courage to do this without it.</p>
<p>The worst case scenario, she knew, would be that she would make herself permanently dumb. But even if she did, she knew she had safety nets. For one, she had saved her current values and could revert to them at any time (in fact, it turned out Master PC had saved her “base state” and she could fully revert back to that if she needed to). Even a much dumber version of herself should be able to load the saved values. And if worse came to worse, Daddy would realize something was wrong if Candice became permanently dumb. She would have to tell him about Master PC, but he would be able to figure it out. Daddy was her ultimate safety net. She knew he didn’t want a permanently dumb wife and would fix her if needed.</p>
<p>She hovered the mouse pointer over the Apply button, closed her eyes, and clicked it.</p>
<p>Candy came, immediately. Before she even felt the changes, before she could even process what she had done. Just knowing that she had made herself into exactly what Daddy wanted did it for her. Her mind went blissfully blank, the complicated thoughts and calculations of Master PC, the ethical dilemmas, the safety nets — all of it dissolved into a warm, buzzing haze. It was as if a switch had been flipped, silencing the incessant chatter in her brain. All that remained was the pure, unadulterated sensation of the vibrator, a delicious hum that now resonated through her entire being. Her body arched, a soft cry escaping her lips as the waves of pleasure intensified, washing over her, leaving her utterly empty and filled all at once. This was what Daddy wanted. This was good. This was perfect. She was perfect. The perfect slut for Daddy.</p>
