        <div class="story-content">
            
<p>“What the fuck is happening?” Candice said to herself, staring into the mirror. The upstairs restrooms at Fox Theater were small single-person affairs, and she was glad for the privacy.</p>
<p>She’d been using Master PC for two weeks. Two weeks! And she was basically already one of those sluts from the stories. She took a deep breath. Calm down, Candice. Calm down. Now that she’d cum, all the brain haziness and submissiveness associated with it had dissipated. She felt almost like her normal self again. This must be what guys are talking about when they say “post-nut clarity,” she thought ruefully.</p>
<p>OK, time to use some of that increased intelligence. She’d expected some level of submissiveness, but not this. She’d set her submissiveness to what had seemed to be a pretty safe level, and she hadn’t experienced anything like that at home, even when she was deep in an orgasm while reading porn. Richard was acting weird too. He had a dominance fetish, sure. But it wasn’t that strong, or he’d have acted on it before. This was wildly out of character even for the new, confident Richard.</p>
<p>And suddenly it all fell into place. Somewhere, while she’d been drunk with sexual desire, the rational part of her brain had realized something was wrong, and had been working out what. It came to her now all at once.</p>
<p>She’d turned up Richard’s sexual desire level to 65% so he’d have a great night too. His dominance level was “when aroused” so the numbers were tied together. She would bet anything that his “dominance” level — what was it, 112? She bet anything that it was higher now that his sexuality was at 65%.</p>
<p>It was the same for her submissiveness. She’d set it pretty high before she’d turned her sexuality up as well. Oh my god, she’d even made other changes too. Were they connected to submissiveness? They could be. One thing she’d learned using Master PC is that changes in one part of a person often affected things elsewhere. She’d completely screwed up the order of operations. She should have set their master sexuality first, then adjusted their dominance and submission. </p>
<p>OK, now she knew what the problem was and she had the solution. She just had to make it home and fix everything.</p>
<p>She heard a knock on the door. “Occupied,” she said.</p>
<p>The door opened. She’d been so flustered she’d forgotten to lock it. She started to say something, but it was Richard. Without asking, he let himself in.</p>
<p>“That,” he said, “was the hottest thing I’ve ever seen in my life.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Candice agreed, as she leaned on the sink, still trying to compose herself. “But now I’m just embarrassed. Let’s go home.”</p>
<p>“Not quite yet,” Richard said.</p>
<p>Candice looked up and saw the look of lust on Richard’s face. He had an almost feral grin as he stepped behind her. </p>
<p>“You couldn’t wait to get home,” he said, “and I can’t either.” He wrapped his arms around her waist and pressed up against her, and she felt his iron-hard erection through his pants digging into her lower back.</p>
<p>“Richard,” she managed, her voice a little shaky, “We can’t. Not here.”</p>
<p>But Richard wasn’t taking no for an answer. </p>
<p>“Anything I want, tonight. Remember?” he said in a low voice, his lips brushing against her ear, sending shivers down her spine. His fingers found the hem of her dress, his touch rough and possessive. The tiny bathroom suddenly felt incredibly hot. The last vestiges of her embarrassment were swiftly melting away, replaced by a potent cocktail of desire and a thrilling sense of recklessness. </p>
<p>“Oh God,” was all Candice managed as his hands slid underneath her dress, and his fingers effortlessly slid into her sopping wet pussy. She definitely hadn’t turned down the beginning of her arousal curve enough. Either that, or Richard was just that damn sexy.</p>
<p>The self-disgust she’d felt earlier was gone, replaced by a surge of raw, unadulterated lust that thrilled and terrified her in equal measure as Candice began to buck her hips against Richard’s fingers. Richard leaned down and with one hand, pulling the straps of her dress off her shoulders, exposing her breasts to the air of the small bathroom. Candice gasped, a sound swallowed by the intensifying pleasure as he continued to expertly slide his fingers in and out of her. </p>
<p>Her gaze darted to Richard’s reflection in the mirror as she started to build to a climax, and what she saw stole her breath away. His eyes, usually warm and kind, were now dark with hunger. This wasn’t the gentle, considerate lover she knew. This was a man completely in command, exuding a raw dominance that both thrilled and captivated her. His face was a mask of pure, unadulterated lust, yet there was no hint of losing control. Rather, it was a deliberate, powerful intensity. She felt a profound shift within herself, a letting go of all pretense that she still had any say in what happened next. </p>
<p>Richard quickened his pace, sliding his fingers in and out faster and faster. His other hand moved to cup her breasts, beginning to grope them roughly. Candice’s eyes remained locked on the mirror, her gaze fixed on the reflection of their intertwined bodies. She watched, mesmerized, as his hand worked her breasts. </p>
<p>“Fuck,” Richard growled, “I didn’t know you were such a slut, Candy. Is this what you like? Being fingered in a bathroom?”</p>
<p>She hated when people called her Candy. She’d always thought it was a demeaning pet name. But that was what made it sexy tonight, what put her over the top. She couldn’t form words, could only moan in response as she arched her back, her fingers clenching around the edge of the sink, knuckles white. Her gaze locked with her own reflection in the mirror, and a gasp tore from her throat as she began to cum. </p>
<p>Her vision blurred, the room spinning as waves of ecstasy crashed over her. She barely registered Richard’s hand leaving her, the shift of his weight behind her. A primal instinct, deeper than thought, took over her body, urging her to lean forward, to brace herself for what was to come. She felt the cool air against her bare buttocks, as he lifted up her dress.</p>
<p>There was no time to reorient herself, no breath to catch, no moment to process. The sound of a zipper, the sudden pressure of his throbbing erection, and then he was inside her — a powerful, rhythmic thrust that stole the air from her lungs. She gasped, a broken sound, as he drove into her from behind, each stroke pushing her further into the abyss of her own arousal.</p>
<p>“Answer me,” he said. “You play at being a strong woman, but deep down this is what you are, isn’t it? A needy slut who needs to be fucked.”</p>
<p>Candice’s eyes met her own in the mirror, and she knew Richard was right. The woman staring back at her was almost unrecognizable — the wildness in her gaze, the slightly parted mouth, the sheen of sweat on her forehead. She watched, mesmerized, as her breasts bounced with each thrust, sending a fresh wave of heat through her. Candice experienced a moment of disassociation. That wasn’t her. Candice was a smart woman, overweight with a low sex drive. The person she saw in the mirror was a beauty from a fashion magazine. No, from a high-end porn video. The woman in the mirror was Candy.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she finally answered. “I am. I’m a slut. I’m nothing but a horny slut.”</p>
<p>“Say it again,” he said. It wasn’t a request, it was a command.</p>
<p>“I’m a slut,” she said, as her eyes darted to Richard’s face, soaking in the air of command he exuded.</p>
<p>“Again.”</p>
<p>“I’m a slut!” she said loudly, looking back at her own reflection once more.</p>
<p>“Again!“</p>
<p>“I’M A SLUT!” she yelled, the unmistakable harmonics of the Command Voice echoing through the small room.</p>
<p>“That’s right you are,” he said. “My slut!“</p>
<p>Candice watched the slut in the mirror as she began to convulse, a strangled cry escaping her lips. She saw the raw, uninhibited pleasure twisting Candy’s features - no, her own features. Candy’s features. Was she Candice or Candy? She couldn’t be sure. Her gaze flickered to Richard’s in the mirror, his face a mask of triumphant satisfaction. His hips bucked once, twice, a primal groan tearing from his throat as he emptied himself deep inside her. She qit, a huge load of cum, more than he’d ever given her before.</p>
<p>Even as he came, he had an aura of power and control, staring into her face. Candice’s orgasm didn’t subside, just intensified as they locked eyes. “Yes,” she gasped as the waves of pleasure crashed over her, “This is what I want. Fill me up! Fill Candy up!“</p>
<p>Her legs buckled. She lost her balance but he held her steady as the orgasm ripped through her. When the tremors finally subsided, a breathless silence fell over the small bathroom. Candice felt a few more pulses as his erection began to soften. Richard’s breathing was still ragged, his arms still tightly wrapped around her as she watched his expression begin to change in the mirror, the dark commanding presence softening back into a more normal Richard.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe we just did that,” he said as he pulled out. Candice felt their combined juices run down her inner thigh. </p>
<p>“Yeah,” Candice agreed. </p>
<p>“Let’s get cleaned up,” Richard said.</p>
<p>Almost without thinking, Candice wiped the fluids rolling down her leg with her finger and sucked it clean. She was still pretty turned on, she realized. That was from the O-Multiplier setting on Master PC, the rational part of her mind said.</p>
<p>“Not exactly what I meant,” Richard said, raising his eyebrows. “But definitely hot.”</p>
<p>He cleaned himself off with a paper towel, zipped up his pants, then helped Candice get her dress straight. When they stepped out of the bathroom, half the patrons were looking at them. The other half were very pointedly not looking at them. A man wearing a shirt and tie was walking in their direction.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have to ask you to leave,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Richard sheepishly. “That makes sense.”</p>
<p>They were walked out of the restaurant, where Richard called an Uber to take them home. The ride back was awkward. Richard sat in silence, still processing what had just happened. Candice knew the feeling — she’d felt that way after she’d fucked Kevin on her first day with Master PC. Of course, Candice had known instantly why she’d acted so out of character. Richard didn’t, and was clearly wrestling with it.</p>
<p>Would he want to fuck her when they got home? She wasn’t sure. He looked really nervous. And she needed a good fucking. Her libido needed to be sated; she was genuinely worried what she would do if she tried to make changes to herself in her current submissive state. But she had accounted for this.</p>
<p>Her entire plan in turning her sexuality up so much was to make sure Richard gave her a night that would make her forget Kevin. She’d turned him up as well to make sure he could give her what she needed. She knew his refractory period should be pretty brief, she just needed to get him turned on again.</p>
<p>“Let us out here,” Candice said to the driver. They were only a block away from the apartment. The car pulled over and Richard got out. This time Richard didn’t walk around to open the door for Candice. She waited for a few seconds until he got the hint.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” he said, opening the door. “I’m a little distracted.” He reached down and held Candice’s hand as she got out.</p>
<p>“It’s OK, I know I don’t usually like the whole chivalry thing. But these heels and this dress makes it really hard to get out without flashing everyone.” She tried to keep it light and breezy, talk to him like a normal person and not let on how horny she still was, that all she wanted to do was drop to her knees and submit to whatever he wanted. She could tell that’s not what he needed to hear right now.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Richard said chuckling, “I could see how walking around in that would be kind of difficult. So why did we stop here?”</p>
<p>“Because you wanted a night out,” Candice said, hooking her arm around his, “and the night is still young.”</p>
<p>In point of fact, it wasn’t even really night at all yet. The last red embers of the sunset were still fading in the sky. Nearby was a trendy bar. It had those big glass garage-door type roll-ups that let them open the interior up to the street on a nice night like this. </p>
<p>“Let’s have a drink,” Candice said, and led Richard inside. It was still relatively early, so they were able to get some good seats, Richard at the bar corner with his back mostly to the street and Candice across the corner facing him. Everyone watched her as they entered, Candice noted, some more obviously than others. Richard had told her that other men looking at her was a turn-on, so she put on a show.</p>
<p>It wasn’t hard, she knew what she looked like. Slowly, she crossed her legs, her left leg fully emerging from the slit on the side of her dress, exposing her skin nearly up to her waist. She felt the warm evening breeze on her partially exposed ass. A man walking by stopped — actually stopped in his tracks. Candice caught his eye and smiled. He almost tripped over his own feet as he turned away. </p>
<p>The bartender took their orders. Richard had another whiskey sour, Candice wasn’t sure he’d touched the one at the restaurant. She ordered a martini.</p>
<p>“A dirty martini,” she specified and gave the bartender a wink. Damn, she was feeling slutty. She turned back to Richard. He was looking at her, but she couldn’t read his expression. </p>
<p>“Penny for your thoughts,” Candice prompted.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Richard said. He was quiet for a moment. “If I ask you something, do you promise to tell me the truth?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“What’s going on?”</p>
<p>Candice wasn’t sure how to answer the question.</p>
<p>“What’s going on with what?”</p>
<p>“With all this,” Richard said, his gesture encompassing the entirety of Candice. “The weight loss, the sex. Tonight. Everything.”</p>
<p>Candice wasn’t sure what to say. She looked at Richard and saw a man trying to work out a puzzle. If this were one of those mind-control stories, Candice knew this would be the part where one of the characters started questioning everything. All the little changes Candice had made to him and to herself had reached a tipping point, and Richard was realizing things weren’t normal. Candice took a big drink of her martini.</p>
<p>“I found out about the stories,” Candice said. She hadn’t planned to say it, the words just came out.</p>
<p>“What stories?” Richard asked.</p>
<p>“The, you know, the erotic ones you’ve been reading.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” Richard’s eyes widened. He looked away sheepishly, unable to meet Candice’s gaze. </p>
<p>“No, it’s fine,” Candice said, grabbing his hand.</p>
<p>“So is that what all this has been about? Fulfilling a fantasy of mine?”</p>
<p>“No! Well, yes. I’m sorry I snooped on your phone. You’d just seemed so distant lately, I didn’t want to lose you.”</p>
<p>“Candice, you’re never going to lose me.” He took a deep breath. “So you lost all this weight and decided to start acting all sexy just because you saw I’d been reading these stories?”</p>
<p>“Well,” Candice started, trying to judge how much to tell him. “It started that way. I’ve always known you liked sex more than me. And I knew I’d gained all that weight and didn’t look like I used to. So I started dieting and working out, and I started reading the stories on that site, and honestly, they were really hot.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Richard asked, surprised. “You liked them?”</p>
<p>“More than I ever thought I would,” Candice lied. “They were so hot, I kept imagining myself as one of the women being controlled and it got me really turned on. So I wanted to act it out with you, but I didn’t know how to tell you without making you feel like I was a creep for snooping on you.”</p>
<p>In truth, Candice had only found those stories hot for about the last four hours, but there was no need to tell Richard the truth about Master PC. Candice had always believed the saying “Two people can keep a secret if one of them is dead,” and she was sure whatever authorities that policed Master PC would come after them if the secret got out.</p>
<p>“So you really, legitimately, enjoyed what we just did?” he asked. He finished off his whiskey and ordered another round. Candice did the same.</p>
<p>“God yes, it was so hot. Honestly, Richard, I’m still horny and I get hornier every time I think about it. That’s why I’ve been so turned on lately, from reading the stories.”</p>
<p>Richard let out a huge sigh, like a weight had been lifted from his shoulders. </p>
<p>“OK,” he said, “so before we go any further, we should establish some ground rules.”</p>
<p>“Rules?” Candice asked. “Like what?”</p>
<p>“Like a safe word. So if I’m doing something to you or give you an order you want to say no to, I know it’s too far.” Richard’s confidence was coming back now that the mystery of the last few weeks had an explanation. And yet, his first concern was still to make sure Candice was OK. God, she really did love the guy.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if we need that,” said Candice. “I trust you.”</p>
<p>“I know, but you did say no in the bathroom, and I didn’t listen. I just… went with it. I thought you wanted it and I’m glad I read the situation right. But Candice? Just now in the car, I was terrified you were going to say I… assaulted you or something.”</p>
<p>Jesus, thought Candice. She’d been trying to give Richard the night of his life, and he’d ended up worried that he had committed rape.  </p>
<p>“OK,” she said. “A safe word. Do you have something in mind?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, a word we rarely say. Like ‘marmalade’ or something.”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Candice agreed. “Marmalade it is. Any other ground rules?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I guess I want to know what you want. What about all this gets you turned on? What are your fantasies?” Candice wasn’t sure how to answer that. Despite what she’d just told Richard, she’d masturbated to a grand total of one mind-control story ever. </p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Candice replied. “I guess I’m still trying to figure out where I want to go with it. For now it’s just the submission. You giving me an order that I obey or being on my knees in front of you. And this,” she said, gesturing around them. “Being out and everyone looking at me. I know you said it turns you on. It turns me on too. And being a slut, like you said in the bathroom when you were fucking me.”</p>
<p>Out of the corner of her eye, Candice noticed the bartender had stopped cleaning the glass he was working on. A couple other patrons had arrived and were waiting to be served, but he was too distracted eavesdropping on them. He was pretty good looking, Candice had to admit. He was one of those guys that had started to bald in their 20s, and just leaned into it by shaving his head, growing a big beard and hitting the gym. </p>
<p>Richard had noticed too. She saw him glance at the bartender, then at a few other patrons whose eyes were on Candice. It was definitely turning him on. Good, thought Candice, he needs to fuck me soon. She tapped her glass for the bartender to refill them for a second time. As he mixed her drink she took a deep breath, her breasts swelling, nearly popping out over the neckline. He dropped the shaker and had to start over. Richard gave her an approving look, and Candice giggled.</p>
<p>“What about you?” she asked Richard, after the bartender stepped away. “I know you’ve been reading them, but I don’t know exactly what parts you find the most sexy.” She realized she was waiting on his answer eagerly. She knew she would do almost anything he told her. </p>
<p>“I guess a lot of the same stuff,” he answered. “But the other way around. Being in control, having a willing… slut,” he said, using the word for the first time in normal conversation. “That’s definitely part of it. I guess the whole fantasy where she’s so turned on she just can’t say no, getting fucked stupid.” She could tell he was getting turned on talking about it. She saw a definite movement in his pants.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you said I was kind of out of it a few times tonight. Which was true, but I was wondering if part of that was you wanting me to be some dumb bimbo. Is that what you want? Me to be your dumb sexy bimbo slut, ready to serve you all the time?” Candice chewed on a bar straw in a way she knew drove guys crazy and leaned towards him, giving him a view of her chest. Just talking about all this had ratcheted up Candice’s arousal another level. Richard leaned in as well. They were turning each other on.</p>
<p>“I want you to know something,” he said after a pause. “This slut thing? This is a fantasy of mine, but it’s just a sex fantasy. I married you because you’re a strong, smart, capable woman. I love having an equal partner, being part of a team. Yes, I love this side of you. I want to really explore it with you. But I want you to know that I’d still love you and stay with you even if you said you never wanted to do this again.”</p>
<p>And just like that, Candice knew she was safe. She didn’t know how far she’d go exploring this new slutty side of herself, but she knew that when she wanted to, she could surrender to Richard’s control completely and it would be okay. That feeling of safety made her even more horny. Admittedly, it was mainly the changes she’d made to herself with Master PC, the stares of all the men in the restaurant, and the four martinis she’d had. But feeling safe with her man was a not-insignificant part of it as well.</p>
<p>“That was the most romantic thing you’ve ever said to me,” Candice said. “You need to take me back to our apartment and fuck me right now.”</p>
<p>Richard grinned. “I think I can do that.”</p>
<hr/>
<p>It was a short walk back to the apartment. Richard was all over her before the door closed. He lifted her effortlessly, carrying her through the living room and into the bedroom. Candice wrapped her legs around his waist, her arms around his neck, pressing herself against him. He didn’t bother to shut the bedroom door and gently lowered her onto the bed.</p>
<p>“Let’s get this off,” he said in a low voice, his hands fumbling with the delicate fabric of Candice’s dress. Candice’s fingers were just as eager, helping him pull it over her head and tossing it carelessly to the side. Having worn no bra or panties, she was already now completely naked.</p>
<p>She marveled at her own body for a moment. She had perfect skin, no hint of a blemish anywhere. No tan lines, no body hair. Just pale creamy flesh. She lay back and began to fondle her breasts. Even on her back, they barely sunk into her chest, retaining their shape in a way they never had before.</p>
<p>Richard wasted no time. He climbed on top of her, his weight a delicious pressure, pinning her to the bed. He leaned down, burying his face in her neck, inhaling her scent. “You’re so hot,” he murmured, his voice thick with lust. “So damn hot.”</p>
<p>His lips moved to her collarbone, trailing wet kisses lower and lower. Candice arched her back, offering herself to him. His mouth found her breast and began suckling hungrily. A moan escaped her lips, a deep, guttural sound she barely recognized as her own. Her nipples had always been sensitive, and she’d turned them up even more. She was sure she could cum just from this with a few more minutes.</p>
<p>“You want this, don’t you, slut?” he whispered, his voice a low rumble against her ear. She loved hearing the word. She was a slut now, she knew it. The thought turned her on more than anything.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Candice gasped.</p>
<p>He took off his shirt and as he did so Candice started on his pants, fumbling at his belt buckle and then freeing his erection. God, he was so hot, Candice realized. The last two weeks of tweaks on him had done wonders. His arms bulged with muscle, and he was beginning to develop a six-pack. His jaw was a little squarer, and the five o’clock shadow of his dark stubble gave him an aura of manliness any woman couldn’t help but want.</p>
<p>Soon they were both completely naked. Richard returned to sucking at her nipples, occasionally giving them little nibbles that shot a combination of pain and pleasure through her body. His hand found her pussy and began sliding his fingers in and out. Candice began to cum almost immediately, a little orgasm that rippled through her like a foreshock portending the Magnitude 10 she knew was on the horizon.</p>
<p>He pulled back just enough to look at her, his eyes filled with the same hunger she’d seen in the restaurant. He positioned himself between her legs, and Candice instinctively opened wider.</p>
<p>“Good girl,” he said, and then he was inside her, a powerful, unwavering thrust that filled her completely. Candice cried out, her breath catching in her throat as he drove into her, again and again. Each stroke was deeper, more insistent, pushing her further into the depths of her own arousal.</p>
<p>She wrapped her legs tighter around his waist, pulling him closer, desperate for more. The bed creaked under their combined weight, a rhythmic accompaniment to their escalating passion. Candice could feel herself building to another climax, a powerful, overwhelming wave of pleasure that threatened to consume her entirely. Richard’s pace quickened, his grunts echoing in the small room.</p>
<p>“Come for me, Candy,” he commanded, his voice raw with desire. “Come for your husband.”</p>
<p>And she did. Her body convulsed around him, a strangled cry tearing from her throat as waves of pure, unadulterated ecstasy washed over her. Richard thrust into her one last time, a powerful groan escaping his lips as he emptied himself deep inside her, filling her completely. He collapsed onto her, his breathing ragged, his body heavy and warm against hers.</p>
<p>“God, that was amazing,” he said. “Twice in one night. We haven’t done that in years.”</p>
<p>Candice lay there, gasping for breath, beneath him, feeling him beginning to soften inside her. Her orgasm had been intense, but it wasn’t enough. He’d cum too fast. She was still on edge, knew she needed more. </p>
<p>“Yeah,” Candice agreed. She shifted out from under him, and he rolled onto his side, his cock coming free. A little bead of cum appeared on the tip.</p>
<p>“Let me clean you up,” Candice said. And before he could answer she took his cock in her mouth. She sucked softly, reveling in the salty taste of him, dancing her tongue around the shaft. It was the most natural thing in the world, and a shiver of pure submission ran through her. This was what a slut was meant for, to pleasure a man. She felt the urge to swallow, to take him deeper.</p>
<p>“Oh god, Candice. That feels amazing, but I don’t think I can go again.” Richard’s voice was a little shaky. Candice ignored him, her focus entirely on the task at hand. Her lips moved rhythmically, her tongue swirling around him, making him moan softly. The last traces of his earlier orgasm were being replaced by a fresh surge of lust.</p>
<p>“Candy,” he groaned, his fingers tangling in her hair, not pulling away, but holding her gently in place. “We just… I just…” She felt the undeniable throb of his renewed erection against her tongue, growing thicker, hotter. He was getting hard again.</p>
<p>She pulled his cock out of her mouth, giving the head a little extra lick for good measure. </p>
<p>“Let me serve you,” she said. “Please? Let Candy serve you.”</p>
<p>Richard shook his head in amazement. “You’re such a slut,” he said. The words sent a shiver through her body. </p>
<p>“She guided him to the edge of the bed, pulled his feet off the edge and kneeled between his legs. She fished her vibrator out of the nightstand. It was a little bullet model. She’d mainly used it for her clit before, but tonight she pushed it past her lips, into her slit and turned it on. Richard watched, his eyes wide with a mixture of awe and arousal as Candice left it there, buzzing inside her and pulled his cock forward, guiding it to her breasts. She pressed it between them, rubbing it against her sensitive skin, marveling at the contrast of his hard, pulsing erection against her soft, yielding flesh.</p>
<p>Richard gasped as she began to move her tits up and down his shaft, creating a friction that she could tell drove him wild. His hands instinctively reached for her hair, holding her head gently as she continued her work. Candice looked up at him, her eyes full of lust, and saw the pure ecstasy on his face. This was her place as a slut, Candice knew.</p>
<p>“Is this what you like?” she asked rhetorically. “Do you like fucking Candy’s huge tits with your big hard cock?”</p>
<p>Richard just moaned.</p>
<p>Candice picked up her pace, her breasts moving faster against him. Richard’s hips bucked in time, a deep growl rumbling in his chest. He pushed her head down, toward her own breasts. He was so big, so hard. She licked the head of his cock each time it surfaced from the pillows of her tits. </p>
<p>She’d never given a tit-fuck before. For one thing, her breasts had only rarely been big enough, and only when she’d been overweight and self-conscious. But mainly because she’d never seen the appeal before. Old Candice would have hated every part of this. Not just the subservience, the woman giving pleasure and the man doing nothing in return. But the symbolism of it too, the woman on her knees.</p>
<p>New Candice — Candy — she loved it. In this moment, pleasing Richard was everything she wanted, and the more she pleased him the more aroused she became.</p>
<p>His breathing became ragged. She pinched her nipples, sending ripples of pleasure through herself. All the while, the vibrator inside her buzzed relentlessly, a constant hum of pleasure that kept her teetering on the edge. He was close, she could feel it. </p>
<p>Candice had a sudden stroke of inspiration. “What would you do, if you could change me?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Nothing. You’re perfect like this.” She felt his grip on her hair tighten.</p>
<p>“No,” she said. “Tell Candy. Like if I was one of those sluts in the stories. What would you do to me if you could change me however you wanted? </p>
<p>He opened his eyes, staring into hers as she bounced her tits up and down on his cock. His eyes dark with a mix of arousal and intense thought. “If I could change you… I’d make you the biggest slut in the world, Candy. You’d wear the sluttiest clothes, showing off your round ass and fat tits, always begging for more.”</p>
<p>Candice saw it all in her mind’s eye: a new version of herself, dressed in a tubetop that stretched across her chest and mini-skirt that barely covered her pussy. Her round ass and full breasts were constantly on display. She saw herself with an insatiable hunger, always pleading for more, always ready for a man’s cock.</p>
<p>“Mmm, and I could be blonde,” Candy said. “Sluts like me are always blonde in the stories.”</p>
<p>He tightened his grip on her hair again, pulling her head slightly further back. “Yeah. You’d look hot as a blonde. Every man would look at you and you’d love every second of it. You’d live to serve, to spread your legs, and show off your perfect body.”</p>
<p>“Then that’s what I’ll be for you,” she purred, her voice husky with desire. “I’ll be your slut, your bimbo. I’m yours, Richard. Candy is your slut. Use me, Richard. Empty your big, hard cock all over Candy’s soft tits. Candy needs it so bad!“</p>
<p>That sent him over the edge. Richard came, jets of cum spurting into the air. Knowing she’d served her man, Candy came as well, the vibrator still buzzing inside her, sending exquisite shivers through her pussy. Richard’s hot cum splattered across her breasts, some hitting her face in a warm, sticky cascade and Candy loved it. The combined sensations were overwhelming, pushing her deeper into a relentless, all-consuming orgasm.</p>
<p>Finally, when the last of the orgasm subsided, Candice knew she was fully sated. She pulled the vibrator out, set it aside, and then began to lick the cum off her breasts. She used her finger to collect what she couldn’t reach with her tongue and sucked it down as well. It tasted terrible, but that didn’t matter to her right now, she knew Richard would want it.</p>
<p>“Mmmmm,” she moaned. “Thank you. Thank you for giving Candy your hot cum.” She was still coming down from the orgasm, her submission beginning to fade, but she wanted to hold onto it a little bit longer, it felt so good.</p>
<p>“Thank you…” she paused, unsure what to say next. “Hmm, saying ‘Thank you Richard’ doesn’t sound right,” Candice purred as she climbed up into bed with him, laying next to her spent man. “Candice calls you Richard. What do you want me to call you when I’m Candy?”</p>
<p>Richard smiled.</p>
