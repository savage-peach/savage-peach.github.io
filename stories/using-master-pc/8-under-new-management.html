        <div class="story-content">
            
<p>Candy returned to work reinvigorated. Everyone immediately noticed the new her. Gone were the conservative and increasingly ill-fitting clothes of the old Candice. Before, she’d tried to hide her Master PC-induced weight loss, tried to avoid attention. Now she dressed for it. She smoothed down her pencil skirt. It was one of the new ones she’d bought—tight, black, and hugging her newly widened hips like a second skin. Her blouse was white silk, unbuttoned just one button too low for a standard corporate environment. She got a lot of compliments from co-workers, especially the men. She loved the attention. It made her pussy warm.</p>
<p>The stodgy old office seemed alive as it never had before. Candy worked for a consulting company. They weren’t Fortune 500 or anything, but they were big enough to have eight floors leased in an older high-rise that had been built in the ’50s and last renovated in the ’90s. </p>
<p>It had always felt drab to Candice, but today all Candy saw was potential. She’d helped herself and Richard, helped River, and now she was going to help other people. The problem she’d had, she realized, was she had been doing too many experiments on herself and Daddy. She’d been overly concerned about changing other people without their consent. But people were infinitely malleable when you had Master PC. There was no change you couldn’t undo if you messed up, unless you did it to yourself. And the more practice she got changing people, the better she could get at helping people. It just made sense.</p>
<p>The only problem was that they would notice. For the changes she’d made to herself, it wasn’t a big deal. She convinced most of the people who came by and complimented her on her new look and weight loss that she’d been undergoing a slow change they hadn’t noticed because she hadn’t updated her clothes. For those that still seemed skeptical, a quick application of the Command Voice was enough. But that didn’t scale. Using the Command Voice took real effort, and she couldn’t follow these people home and convince their friends and family.</p>
<p>There was an option she’d avoided using on herself, but now was the perfect time to try it out. It was called Acceptance, and existed on the Meta-Control tab. She’d been reading up on it.</p>
<p>Acceptance is a powerful feature any would-be Master must be aware of, the documentation read, and essential for making large-scale changes. When enabled, the subject won’t realize anything has changed, and if confronted with evidence they’ve been altered, they will rationalize it away, within limits. The feature has a plethora of sub-options that…</p>
<p>Candy stopped reading. The documentation was sooooo boring. Better to learn by doing. For instance, she wondered what, exactly, “within limits” meant. Of course, the documentation was vague. Candy decided she should probably experience Acceptance once, just so she understood it better. Not on a change to herself, of course. If there was anything she’d learned over the last few days, making changes to yourself that you don’t fully understand was a recipe for unintended consequences.</p>
<p>Candy surveyed the office, her eyes settling on Morgan’s small breasts. The poor girl was extremely flat chested. Candy turned up her boob size to something more reasonable, but didn’t click Apply yet. She checked “Acceptance,” then checked the sub-options underneath it. There was an option to make the “Acceptance” contagious, allowing the target’s rationalizations to spread, which seemed like a good idea to keep any friends and family from becoming suspicious, and a checkbox labeled ‘User Immunity,’ which she deliberately un-checked. Of course, normally she’d want to be immune, but she wanted to feel what it was like so she’d know how effective it was. Then she wrote a note to herself.</p>
<p>You have made Morgan’s tits bigger. Try to remember her boobs used to be smaller.</p>
<p>Then Candy clicked Apply and looked at Morgan again. Her tits were pretty average. Oops, I forgot to actually make them bigger, she realized, and turned up Morgan’s chest size until her 3D model looked suitably busty. She clicked Apply.</p>
<p>Candy looked at Morgan again. There she was, wearing a shirt that was clearly too small for the chest she had. Morgan must really like showing off her boobs, Candy considered. She looked at the note she’d written. Had Morgan’s boobs been smaller before? She really tried to think about it. Oh, right! How could she have forgotten? They’d been like A cups before, at best. Morgan must have gotten breast augmentation. The girl liked having big boobs, and that’s why Candy had decided to increase them even more. She turned them up to something Morgan could really be proud of and hit Apply.</p>
<p>Candy looked at Morgan again with her ridiculous chest and then back to her note. On second thought, Candy decided she shouldn’t really turn them up any more. Sure, Morgan must love having a huge rack or she wouldn’t have gotten the surgery, but there was definitely a limit. She threw the sticky note away.</p>
<p>As she did, she noticed there were several other notes in her trashcan. She had been planning to test Acceptance for a few other changes too, like making Lisa younger and making Ryan more attractive. Lisa, who was, what, fresh out of high school? And Ryan, the office stud?</p>
<p>Then it clicked. Oops. Well, at least she knew Acceptance was incredibly effective. With that feature turned on, she would be able to help people without anyone being the wiser. Candy began to browse through her co-workers’ profiles, this time making herself immune to Acceptance. </p>
<p>Dave worked with Candy on the company website. He was 5‘6” and occasionally made little self-deprecating jokes to Candy, the fellow “shorty squad” member in the office. She knew he wished he was taller. Well, now he was. </p>
<p>Olivia in Marketing had depression. She never looked happy, and Master PC confirmed it. Happiness was a top-line trait in Master PC’s Mental tab, an easy fix. Candy turned it up. And as long as she was making her happier, why not turn up her O-Index? Candy knew that would make her happier too.</p>
<p>Aidan had confidence issues. And, she saw once she loaded his profile, a small penis. She fixed both. While she was fiddling with his penis settings, Candy decided to drop his refractory period too. Just to make sure he would enjoy it.</p>
<p>Ava had ovarian cancer. Jesus. She’d never told anyone in the office as far as Candy knew. Did she even know herself? There was no “remove cancer” button, but there was an overall “Health” slider. Candy turned it up and hoped that helped. Then she had a really good idea. Ovarian cancer would stop you from having babies, right? She found the Fertility setting and turned it up. Perfect. That would have to fix ovarian cancer. She felt really smart for thinking of it. Plus, the image of Ava getting knocked up was kind of hot. Candy pressed her thighs together thinking about it, then turned up the girl’s Sexuality slider too.</p>
<p>She was still making changes to her coworkers when her computer dinged; a calendar reminder had popped up.</p>
<p>Meeting with Mr. Sterling - 15 Minutes</p>
<p>Shit! She’d completely forgotten. Mr. Sterling was the VP of Engineering, her boss’s boss. Last week she’d run into him and suggested that she would be a “GOOD CANDIDATE FOR PROMOTION.” Shortly after, this meeting had appeared on her calendar. It was the opportunity to use Master PC to benefit her career. A few simple applications of the Command Voice, and she’d be a Director in no time.</p>
<p>The meeting location was on the top floor of their building, not Mr. Sterling’s usual office. The room she stepped into was clearly in transition; boxes were stacked haphazardly against one wall, but the rest of the room boasted sleek, modern furniture—a glass desk, ergonomic chairs, and a minimalist bookshelf—a stark contrast to the building’s otherwise dated aesthetic. It looked like he was unpacking. The walls were bare, and his desk only contained a single picture for decoration—a photo of a woman Candy assumed was his wife holding a baby. </p>
<p>Mr. Sterling himself stood by the window, adjusting the blinds. He was a decent looking man in his early fifties. He was tall (why were managers always tall?) and broad-shouldered with salt-and-pepper hair that gave him a commanding presence. He turned to Candy as she walked in, a look of confusion crossing his face.</p>
<p>“Can I help you?” he asked.</p>
<p>“You put a meeting on my calendar,” Candy answered. “But there wasn’t any topic listed.”</p>
<p>Mr. Sterling’s expression changed to one of surprise. “Candice. Of course. I didn’t recognize you. My apologies, I’m still trying to sort out this new office, and my mind is everywhere.” He gestured to the room. “Please, come in. Have a seat. The topic is you, actually. Or rather, your career.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said, taking a seat. “I feel I have a lot to offer the company.”</p>
<p>“We haven’t made the formal announcement yet,” he said, taking a seat behind his desk, “but as you can see I’ve been moved up to the C-Suite. EVP of Operations.”</p>
<p>“Congrats,” she said.</p>
<p>“Thank you. With the new role, I’m going to need someone close by to help me manage the workload.”</p>
<p>“Like a secretary?” Candy asked, the words slipping out before she could stop them. She’d been reading a lot of those mind control stories lately where smart women were reduced to being nothing but brainless secretaries for their bosses. The thought of being his secretary, fetching coffee and taking dictation, sent a jolt of arousal straight to her pussy.</p>
<p>“No,” Sterling corrected her. “Amy will be staying on as my Administrative Assistant. This is more of a Chief of Staff position. Someone who knows the engineering side but can also handle the softer skills. Organization, personnel management, acting as my proxy when I’m not in the room. And I need someone who’s been in the code recently, who can call out bullshit on timelines and deliverables.”</p>
<p>He looked at her critically. “The title would officially be Senior Director. It would be a significant step up from where you are now, both in terms of pay and power. You’d be my right hand.”</p>
<p>Power. She felt a flush of heat spread through her body, but it wasn’t the desire to have power that hit her; it was the proximity to his power. Sterling exuded authority. </p>
<p>And that was the problem.</p>
<p>Her “submissive-when-aroused” settings, the ones she’d tuned so carefully for Richard, were pinging wildly. Being in the presence of a powerful man who was judging her worth was turning her on, and being turned on was making her dumb and submissive.</p>
<p>“So,” Sterling continued, “Tell me. How would you handle a situation where two department heads are deadlocked on a resource allocation issue? Walk me through your negotiation strategy.”</p>
<p>Candice, the software engineer, had read management books. She’d been ambitious. But right now her mind was a fog of arousal. Candy tried to come up with a good answer.</p>
<p>“I would… start by analyzing the project roadmaps,” she managed, the technical terms feeling slippery. “Then I’d try to facilitate a compromise. You know, find a middle ground where both teams feel heard and supported, to keep morale high.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a terrible answer, she knew. It was standard HR-approved management speak. But it wasn’t the answer he was looking for.</p>
<p>Sterling frowned slightly. “Compromise is often a recipe for mediocrity. I need someone who can determine the critical path and make the hard call, not just smooth ruffled feathers.”</p>
<p>“I…” Her mind went blank. She felt small. She felt like a naughty schoolgirl called into the principal’s office. Use the Voice, the part of her that was Old Candice insisted. Just tell him: YOU THINK I’M THE PERFECT CANDIDATE.</p>
<p>She gathered her breath, trying to summon the harmonic chords of the Command Voice. But as she looked into Sterling’s steel-gray eyes, the words died in her throat. How could she command such a powerful man? She wanted to kneel. She wanted to please. The conditioning she’d installed for Daddy was bleeding over, short-circuiting her plans.</p>
<p>“I’m… I’m sorry,” she squeaked. “I’m a little flustered.”</p>
<p>Sterling sighed, a sound of disappointment that cut her deep. He glanced at his watch. “Look, Candice. You’re a talented engineer. But maybe this role is a bit premature. We need someone who can command a room.”</p>
<p>He turned his chair slightly, ready to dismiss her. Candy felt the blood rushing to her face. Panic flared, hot and sharp. Old Candice would have retreated, gone back to her desk, and cried in the bathroom. Old Candice would have spent weeks analyzing where she went wrong.</p>
<p>But Candy knew just what to do. She realized she couldn’t get this job with her brain. Her brain was betraying her, melting down into a puddle of submissive desire. But she had other assets. She was a slut. A 60-point slut with a body sculpted by godlike software. She stood up.</p>
<p>“Mr. Sterling?”</p>
<p>He looked up, expecting her to leave. “Yes?” His tone was impatient.</p>
<p>“I think I gave you the wrong impression,” she said. The hesitation was gone. Her voice dropped to a purr, losing the nervousness and gaining a smoky texture.</p>
<p>She walked to the door, but instead of leaving, she closed it.</p>
<p>Sterling stiffened. “Candice, this meeting is over.”</p>
<p>“Is it?” she asked softly, walking back. She rested a hip against the edge of his desk. “You said you needed a Chief of Staff who can anticipate your needs. Someone who knows how to take care of things.”</p>
<p>Sterling stared at her. “I’m just not sure you’re ready for the responsibility,” he said. His voice was guarded, but he hadn’t told her to leave yet.</p>
<p>“I’m always ready,” Candy countered, holding his gaze. “And I can be very… flexible. I’m a fast learner who’s good at taking orders… Sir.” She licked her lips.</p>
<p>“You’re crossing a line, Candice,” he said, his voice tight. But Candy could see the erection tenting his pants.</p>
<p>“Maybe crossing lines is just what you need,” Candy purred, taking a step towards him.</p>
<p>There was a moment’s pause, and then Sterling shook his head. “No. I’m sorry Candice, but I’m going to ask you to leave. Not just this office, but this building. You’re fired.” He stood up from his chair and started to brush past Candy, heading for the door.</p>
<p>“STOP,” she said in a panic. Sterling froze. So she could use the Command Voice on him, if she needed to. Maybe she hadn’t been able to bring herself to force a powerful man like him to give her a job, but now she was revved up with sexual energy. </p>
<p>“No one has to know,” she said, and stepped closer to him as he stood frozen. She pushed on his chest, and he sat back down into the chair. “I know you want to. What man hasn’t had the fantasy of fucking a beautiful woman who works for him? Well here’s your chance.” She sank into his lap, her sharp white nails grazing the expensive fabric of his suit trousers, tracking the seam right over his zipper. She felt him twitch from her caress.</p>
<p>Sterling let out a sharp breath. He glanced at the door, then into Candy’s eyes. “We can’t,” he said, but he was still unmoving, either from the Command Voice, his own desire, or a combination of the two.</p>
<p>Candy didn’t say a word. With practiced ease, she undid his belt. Sterling gripped the armrests of his chair, but he made no move to stop her. As she freed his cock, she felt a rush of triumph. This was power. This was how she got ahead now. Not with spreadsheets or code, but with sex.</p>
<p>Candy didn’t smile, just held his intense gaze as she stroked him. She opened her mouth, inviting a kiss, but he just stared into her eyes. She could see a war playing out in his expression. He wanted to fuck her, but if they were caught it would be the end of his career. Candy decided to give him permission in a way only she could.</p>
<p>“TAKE ME,” she said. Instantly, his expression changed. Gone was the hesitation, the worry about what HR might do. All that was left was the lust he felt for his beautiful subordinate. His rough hands clamped onto her breasts, kneading the soft flesh. He undid the buttons, freeing her tits, and began playing with her nipples. Candy gasped at the thrill of being aggressively fondled, but she didn’t stop stroking his cock. This wasn’t the loving, possessive dominance of Daddy; this was just raw lust, the illicit nature making it even hotter.</p>
<p>Finally, she couldn’t take it anymore. She slid off his lap and turned her back to him, bent over the glass-topped desk, and put her hands flat on the cool surface, presenting her ass to him.</p>
<p>The silence in the expensive office was broken only by her shallow, rapid breaths. For a moment she was worried he wouldn’t take her. That he’d somehow overcome the Voice and she’d be fired. That she’d have to explain to Daddy what happened.</p>
<p>“Please, Sir,” she whispered. Then she felt it: he pushed her skirt up, bunching it around her waist, and pushed into her. He wasn’t as big as Daddy, but that wasn’t important. He was powerful, he was dominating, and he was using her. He grabbed her hips and began to pump in and out.</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir!” she moaned, trying to be quiet in the office. “Please, Sir, use me!“</p>
<p>“I won’t lie,” he said, not pausing as he thrust in and out of her, “I’ve been thinking about this since the moment you walked in.”</p>
<p>Candy loved it. Daddy was always so… excited when he fucked her. He made sure Candy enjoyed it. This felt different. Sterling made her feel used, and the thrill of it was intoxicating. The high-stakes environment, the risk of discovery, and the power dynamics of fucking her boss heightened her arousal to a dizzying level. It was the purest form of submission, being claimed and used without love.</p>
<p>“Oh, God, Sir, yes!” Candy gasped, trying to stay quiet. The cold hard glass of the desk pressed against her over-sensitive nipples, sending shockwaves of pleasure through her already overwhelmed body. With each thrust she felt her nipples drag across the cold glass again, and she reveled in the sensation.</p>
<p>“I’ve got to say, I like your initiative,” her new boss said as he sank into her rhythmically. </p>
<p>“I’m happy to be of service, Sir!” Candy panted. With each thrust, she felt his balls slapping against her. She’d never really felt that with Daddy. She wondered if it was because his didn’t hang quite as low as Sterling’s. It felt amazing. </p>
<p>Comparing Sterling to Daddy, she suddenly realized she was cheating again. She’d done it with Kevin and with River as well, but those times she hadn’t really been in her right mind. She’d been able to rationalize it away before. This was the first time she’d actively chosen to cheat on Daddy. The man who loved her, who’d encouraged her to become a slut. The man who’d be heartbroken if he found out she’d betrayed their marriage.</p>
<p>A little wave of guilt washed over her, but Candy recognized it as the remains of her old self. This is wrong, the little voice that was Candice whimpered. But the transgression only made the sex hotter to Candy. After all, she was a slut. This was who she was now. This was her place. She bit her lip to stifle a scream as she came hard with the knowledge she was doing exactly what she should be.</p>
<p>“You know, maybe you are just what I need for a Chief of Staff,” Sterling said as he pulled out. He lifted her onto the desk and turned her around so she was lying on her back. “Now tell me what you need to take over that Senior Director role. Start with the compensation package.” His cock slammed back into her, and Candy wrapped her legs around him, pulling him closer.</p>
<p>“Uh… oh God… a two-hundred percent raise and a bonus… like, a really big one, Sir,” Candy slurred, the words barely making sense even to her own ears. </p>
<p>Sterling considered it for a moment as he fucked her, his gray eyes boring into her.</p>
<p>“A two-hundred percent raise? That would probably be appropriate for the position, if you could do it. Tell you what. I’ll give you a hundred percent increase and a one-time signing bonus of five thousand dollars. And that’s me being generous because I like your attitude.”</p>
<p>That was well below what a Senior Director should be making, she knew. The complete dismissal of her request stung, but that sting of rejection felt so good. He was putting her in her place. Her mind, already a blur, melted further into submission. </p>
<p>“But I… I’m going to be your Senior Director,” she managed feebly.</p>
<p>“You’ll be the Senior Director, Candy. But I’m taking the budget I would have used for that position and splitting it to hire you an assistant. Someone who can handle the analysis and reporting. Someone smart enough to cover your ass.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir!” she moaned, as she began to cum again, reveling in the feeling of being simultaneously promoted and demoted, praised for her body and dismissed for her brain, all at the hands of her new, powerful boss. “Thank you, Sir! I’ll be your perfect asset! Use the budget for her! Use me!“</p>
<p>He didn’t answer with words, just with a series of hard, driving thrusts that made the desk creak beneath her and a low moan as his cock began to pulse inside her. Candy clung to him as he came, riding out her own orgasm as she felt him unload inside her pussy.</p>
<p>When he pulled out, he sank back into his chair, his face becoming a mix of satisfaction and worry, once again clearly thinking about what would happen if anyone found out. Candy slid off the desk and crawled up to him, putting her head in his lap and nuzzling his cock. “You don’t have to worry, Sir. I’d do this job for no raise. It’s… good experience. I’ll move up the ladder, and you’ll get your needs met. We both win.”</p>
<p>“I guess we do,” he agreed.</p>
<p>She began to lick him clean, her saliva getting him hard once more. Later, while Mr Sterling was fucking her doggy-style again, she texted Daddy to let him know she got the promotion.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Candy checked her reflection in her phone. It confirmed what she already knew: she looked amazing.</p>
<p>It had been just over a week since Candy had gotten her promotion. She was sitting at Le Jardin, a bistro that was just expensive enough to keep out the riff-raff. Today she was wearing a powder blue sheath dress. It was sleeveless, showing off her smooth, toned arms. The neckline was actually very conservative, but she’d used Master PC to make sure it hugged her figure just right.</p>
<p>She sipped on a Cosmopolitan. She had to go back to work later, but it was fine. She didn’t need to worry too much about getting a little tipsy. Life as a slut was just so much easier than life as a software engineer.</p>
<p>“Candice?”</p>
<p>Candy looked up. Standing by the table was her best friend, Mia. They’d bonded in college, both being CS majors in a male-dominated field. Mia was just a couple years older, in her early 30s, having been a senior when Candice was a freshman. Mia had stayed for her Master’s Degree, so they’d had a good three years together at college.</p>
<p>Candy began looking her friend over critically, the way she did everyone these days, considering how she might help her with Master PC. God, she was tall. Mia had always been the elegant one of their friend group. She was just over six feet in heels, with a slender frame and a long, graceful neck that reminded Candy of a swan. Today she was wearing a structured navy blazer and tailored trousers that screamed ‘corporate power’ in a way that used to intimidate Candice. Now, Candy just thought she looked constricted.</p>
<p>“Mia! Oh my god, sit down!” Candy squealed, doing a little shimmy in her seat.</p>
<p>Mia didn’t smile immediately. She sat down slowly; her face was etched with concern. </p>
<p>“I didn’t believe the pictures I saw online,” Mia said, her voice carefully neutral.</p>
<p>“Do you like it?” Candy asked, flashing a bright, white smile. “I went blonde! And, you know, made a few other changes.”</p>
<p>“I see that,” Mia said. She ordered an iced tea from the waiter, waving away the menu. Candy ordered a second Cosmo. </p>
<p>Once the waiter left, Mia leaned in, her elbows on the table. “Candice, I wanted to meet because I’m worried about you. I saw the Instagram posts. The ‘Candy’ thing. And now seeing you in person…”</p>
<p>“I’ve never been better! I got promoted, Mia! Senior Director!” Candy beamed.</p>
<p>“That’s great, really,” Mia said. “But Candice, we had lunch two weeks ago. You were… you.” She gestured vaguely at Candy’s body. “You’ve lost so much weight. And your… chest. It’s huge. I never expected you to get breast implants.”</p>
<p>“I’ve always been busty,” Candy said. “They’re not much bigger than they used to be.”</p>
<p>“No offense, Candice, but when you lose weight your breasts get smaller too. I’m not an idiot.”</p>
<p>Oh God, this again. She wished she could just turn on Acceptance for herself, but the documentation was absolutely unclear how it worked if you wanted to affect other people but not the target of the changes.</p>
<p>“I’VE BEEN LOSING WEIGHT FOR A WHILE,” she said. “YOU JUST DIDN’T NOTICE BECAUSE I WAS WEARING MY OLD BAGGY CLOTHES.”</p>
<p>Mia blinked slowly, the way Candy had come to expect when using the Voice.</p>
<p>“No,” she finally said.  “I… I would have noticed that.” She looked confused.</p>
<p>What the hell? That had never happened before. Was Mia resistant somehow? Candice dug down, trying to summon every ounce of energy she could and put it into the Voice. “YES,” she said, “MY LOOK MAKES SENSE. I LOST WEIGHT SLOWLY AND YOU DIDN’T NOTICE.” She felt the resistance from Mia, but was able to push through it. She’d never had this much trouble with the Voice before. She knew it took energy—the documentation said it was harder to use when tired, and excessive use would exhaust your own mental reserves. But she’d used it a lot more than this on River the other day, and it had been fine. She watched Mia carefully, gauging her reaction.</p>
<p>“I… I guess so,” the tall woman finally replied, even though she still looked a little skeptical. “I mean, you couldn’t have actually lost 30 pounds in two weeks. Right?”</p>
<p>Candice breathed a sigh of relief. “Right,” she agreed. </p>
<p>There was a long pause. “So, does Richard like this?” Mia finally asked.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, Da—Richard loves it. A lot of this was his idea, actually.”</p>
<p>“Mmmm,” Mia said noncommittally. “I didn’t think you’d change so much for a guy.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t change for a guy,” Candy countered, waving a perfectly manicured hand dismissively. “I changed for me. I was a boring, fat, invisible engineer. Now I’m a Senior Director. I’m hot. I get what I want. It’s called self-improvement, Mia. You should try it.” She took a large sip of her Cosmopolitan, the alcohol a sweet, fruity rush. “Speaking of which, you look tired. You know, a little more relaxation, a little less stress would do wonders for you.” She was pretty sure there was a “Stress” slider on the Mental tab.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, maybe one day. And Senior Director? How’d you manage that? Aren’t there usually a few steps in between Software Engineer and Senior Director?”</p>
<p>“I think my boss just liked my… enthusiasm,” she answered. “I’ve been helping him with some really long, hard projects.”</p>
<p>Mia’s eyes opened wider. “Oh my God, are you sleeping with him?”</p>
<p>“No!” Candy lied, “Of course not!“</p>
<p>“Oh come on, that was totally a double entendre.”</p>
<p>“Mia, I have a boyfriend.”</p>
<p>“Uh, no, you have a husband. You’ve been married for five years.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” Candice said, “Right. That’s what I meant.” It was easy to forget you were married when you were such a slut.</p>
<p>“What the fuck is going on with you right now?”</p>
<p>“NOTHING! EveRYthING is FinE!” Candice said. She felt the Voice giving out. It was like trying to sing after you’d just been screaming at the top of your lungs. She just couldn’t pull the harmonics together. She needed time to get it back.</p>
<p>“No. It’s not. I’m worried about you.”</p>
<p>Candy floundered, unsure what to say. Tell her about Richard’s software project, the little voice in her head said. Oh yeah, that would work. She still occasionally had smart ideas.</p>
<p>“OK, Mia, look. If you’re worried about me, why don’t you come over tonight?”</p>
<p>“Over where?”</p>
<p>“To my place. Look, Richard and I have been working on something. He’s got a brilliant idea about some Market Analytics software, but he’s no coder. I’ve been trying to help him, but, y’know. You have your Master’s. You know some more theoretical stuff than I do. I’m just… tired, you know. I work hard during the day, and then when I get home it’s more code.”</p>
<p>That should work. Python libraries and API integrations were like catnip to Mia. Candy wouldn’t be surprised if she masturbated to source code. This could kill two birds with one stone. She could get Mia over again tonight so she could make some changes, and get Daddy someone to help him with his project. He had been bringing up his coding idea more and more lately, and there was only so long she could distract him with blowjobs.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Mia said skeptically.</p>
<p>“Great,” Candy said, ignoring her hesitation. “See you at 6:00.”</p>
<p>Candy got up before Mia could protest. She wiggled her ass subconsciously as she walked away.</p>
