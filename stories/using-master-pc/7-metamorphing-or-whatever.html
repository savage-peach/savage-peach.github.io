        <div class="story-content">
            
<p>Well, that had been a disaster.</p>
<p>Candice was eating lunch, taking advantage of the warm weather to sit outside at one of her favorite downtown cafes. She sat with her legs crossed, absentmindedly dangling her platform heel from the tip of her toe as she picked at her salad and considered what had just happened.</p>
<p>The sex with River had been literally mind-blowing. After Candice had come down from the orgasm, River had finished the pedicure in a daze and Candice had made her exit. The nail tech had been disappointed when Candice had told her she had a boyfriend, but was clearly eager to meet “Candy” again under any circumstances. </p>
<p>What had gone wrong this time? Clearly, it was the mind-reading power. Or at least, the mind-reading coupled with “dumbification” when aroused. Her general sluttiness and enhanced libido had factored in as well. Something was going to have to go. All these powers and changes were a potent mix that had really done a number on her brain and self-control.</p>
<p>Candice really wanted to keep the mind-reading. That was the one power she’d selected to not be sex-related, but it seemed to have caused the most issues. She could probably keep it if she turned her libido down again, or tweaked the arousal curve some more, but she didn’t really want to be less sexual. She was a slut, after all.</p>
<p>In fact, the more Candice thought about it, the less of a disaster it seemed. Sure, she’d cheated on Richard. Again. But this time it was with a girl, a girl that seemed eager to come home and meet Candy’s boyfriend. Surely Richard would love that. Every guy dreams of a threesome. And it’s not like Richard didn’t know Candice was a slut. What did he expect? It was kind of his fault, if you thought about it. He was the one that had made Candice say it out loud, even if he hadn’t known about the Command Voice.</p>
<p>She’d have to be careful about how she broached the subject with Richard, though. She didn’t want him finding out she’d already pre-fucked River. He might not like that. In fact, he definitely wouldn’t. Of course, what he doesn’t know won’t hurt him, she considered. </p>
<p>The thought surprised Candice. When she’d stumbled out of the nail salon, still riding high from the orgasm, she’d expected feelings of shame and guilt to creep in, just as they had after she’d fucked Kevin. But now, twenty minutes later, as she sat picking at her lunch and feeling comparatively like herself, Candice realized she didn’t feel any remorse for the act itself, just worry that Richard would be mad. She dug deep, examined her feelings, looking for any hint of guilt within herself, and found none. Instead it just felt natural. Sluts sleep around, she knew, and she was a slut.</p>
<p>A bisexual slut, for that matter. The experience with River had ingrained itself so deeply that she now found herself checking out both men and women who walked by. It was fortunate, in a way, that the mind-reading fiasco had been with another woman. What if it had been with Richard? What if she’d opened her mind to his, and felt what it was like to have a dick when you cum? Instead of incorporating lust for women into her psyche, would she have become hung up on wanting a cock? It was possible, both theoretically and practically. Master PC had “futanari” settings, after all. Candice shuddered at the thought. She was definitely going to have to turn off mind-reading. She didn’t trust herself with it anymore. </p>
<p>Candice paid for her lunch and pulled out her phone to call an Uber. Instagram caught her eye again. There were a few more comments on her earlier selfie, a mix of guys crushing on her, and friends who were debating whether the picture was a filter or pure AI. Well, everyone was going to have to get used to the new her. She decided to take another selfie, this time showing off her new, bright white nails.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trying something new! ✨💅✨</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There. Now everyone would know it was her doing something different with her look, not some AI slop.</p>
<p>A new notification came in. This time from Richard. </p>
<div class="chat-message msg-received"><p>Hey baby, when are you going to be home? Daddy's waiting 😉</p></div>
<p>Daddy. The word alone now excited Candice. She felt her body flush, her pussy already getting wet. And she’d only had sex with River half an hour ago! But it hadn’t been with Daddy, and Candice knew it would be so much better with him. He hadn’t seen her yet today. The blonde hair, the audacious clothes. After the theater, he’d told her his fantasy, what kind of woman she’d be if only he had the power to change her. She’d taken his words to heart, reshaped herself to reflect his deepest desires. She couldn’t wait to show him. After she turned down some of the sexual and brain-drain settings, of course.</p>
<div class="chat-message msg-sent"><p>Just called an Uber, Daddy. I'll be home soon 😘</p></div>
<p>She summoned the Uber. She could have walked, but she had a lot of bags, and she wanted to get home as fast as possible.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Candice cracked the door open to her apartment just a hair and listened. Inside, she heard the sound of gunfire from whatever shooting game Richard was playing these days. He was wearing his usual weekend outfit of worn-out shorts and a t-shirt, though she had to admit he filled them out much better now. She knew he was playing multiplayer, because he had his headset on. </p>
<p>She hoped that would give her the chance to slip in unnoticed, but as soon as she took a step inside he caught sight of her. His eyes widened, taking in her new hair, her perfectly made-up face, the impossibly short skirt, and the too-small tube top. </p>
<p>“Candice?!” he finally managed.</p>
<p>“Hi hon,” she said, trying to pretend she hadn’t been sneaking in. “I’m home.”</p>
<p>“Gotta go,” he said into the headset, and tossed it aside. “Come here,” he said. “I need to see this.”</p>
<p>Candice couldn’t help herself. She needed to get to Master PC, but this was the whole point of everything she’d done today: to be admired by Daddy. She walked towards him, hips swaying, her platform heels clicking on the floor.</p>
<p>He pushed himself up from the couch, his eyes still wide, and took a step toward her. He reached out and touched her hair, running a hand over the blonde strands. “It’s… it’s incredible,” he breathed, a raw hunger entering his voice. “You actually did it. You look exactly how I imagined you would.” Candice swooned at the compliment. Being perfect for Daddy was everything. “And this outfit,” he continued. “Did you actually go out in this?”</p>
<p>Candice looked down at herself. She wouldn’t have been caught dead in it last week. But that was the old Candice, not the new and improved Candy. </p>
<p>“I wish I’d been there,” Richard said. “To see all the guys checking you out.”</p>
<p>“Well, I wanted to surprise you with the blonde look,” Candice demurred. “And I got some other things. Give me a minute to get ready.”</p>
<p>She wiggled out of his grip and ducked into the office with her shopping bags, closing the door behind her. The room was small, with a work desk and a small closet Candice used to keep a few of her less-worn outfits in. </p>
<p>Quickly, Candice booted up the laptop. The wait for the Windows login screen was interminable. Daddy wanted her, and everything in her Master PC-enhanced submissive state was telling her to get out there and serve him, do just what he wanted. She was only able to resist by telling herself he didn’t want her to go off the deep end again.</p>
<p>“Candice?” she heard him call. “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Just one second, Daddy.”</p>
<p>Candice caught movement out of the corner of her eye. She took a startled breath, thinking someone was in the room with her. But no. It had just been her own reflection in the mirror that hung next to the closet. She just hadn’t recognized herself. </p>
<p>Candice had a moment of clarity. She stared at her reflection and saw a woman she didn’t know. A woman who wore the face of a younger, prettier version of herself, but with a body she’d never possessed and an attitude that would have been alien to her a few weeks ago. A woman who oozed sex, straight out of a porno, or one of those mind-control stories she’d been reading lately. In that moment she knew she was losing control. All her changes were adding up to the point that she was becoming another person, becoming Candy instead of Candice. It was like they were Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, if Hyde was a sexy bimbo. </p>
<p>It had all seemed to make sense at the time, each little step. Just be a little submissive when aroused; plenty of people were like that. Just turn up her libido to have better sex; why not? But they’d compounded, turning her into someone who worshiped strong men. And when she was in that submissive state, she’d done more, things she’d never have dared to do otherwise. Like make herself dumber, for one.</p>
<p>But she didn’t want to be dumb, she realized. She didn’t want to be submissive and horny all the time. She didn’t want to be a slut. For the first time, she became truly afraid of what she’d done to herself. She was a strong, smart woman whose life goals extended beyond fucking and sucking cock. </p>
<p>Finally, the laptop finished booting up. She launched Master PC, hands shaking with adrenaline. Quickly, she browsed to the Secondary Control section and disabled Mind Reading and hit Apply. That was the biggest problem solved. She flipped to the Mental tab, to begin undoing the intelligence drain.</p>
<p>“Hon?” she heard Richard call. </p>
<p>“Just one more minute.”</p>
<p>“Get out here. Now.” She heard the order from the other side of the door and  closed the laptop, automatically. Candice couldn’t resist when Richard took charge. Not anymore. She opened the door. “I… I was just getting ready for you, Daddy,” she stammered.</p>
<p>Richard stepped in close. “Jesus, Candy. You look amazing. You don’t need to do anything else.” He loomed over her, his presence enough to make her knees weak. She felt her body responding, her pussy getting wet again. Her new body was positively insatiable.</p>
<p>“You like?” she asked, smiling. Oh well, one more orgasm under her heightened sexuality wouldn’t hurt, right? She’d already cum three times today.</p>
<p>“On your knees,” he commanded.</p>
<p>Candy dropped instantly, as if gravity had suddenly increased. She heard him inhale sharply as she reached for his pants, undoing the zipper, and in no time his cock was in her mouth. She sucked him with practiced ease, her tongue circling the head. She took him as deep as she could without gagging. There was a setting in Master PC to disable her gag reflex, she remembered. Why haven’t I done that yet, she wondered. Oh well, something for next time.</p>
<p>“Good girl,” he growled, the rough sound vibrating with power. He grabbed a handful of her blonde hair, pulling her head back to control the pace. “Suck it, Candy. You know you want it.” She eagerly complied, the name “Candy” now feeling more natural than “Candice.” This was exactly what she wanted: to be commanded, to please him, to be his perfect, insatiable slut. The moment of clarity she’d had just seconds ago began to evaporate.</p>
<p>She got lost in the act, her thoughts beginning to unwind. She felt detached as he pulled her by the hair to stand and bent her over the office desk. Her pussy offered no resistance as he entered. She just moaned. There were no words, just fucking. Her hand rested on her computer, the very one that Master PC was installed on, the very thing that she had just been about to use to undo so much of her extreme sexuality. But it might as well have been on the Moon, for all the good it did her. She couldn’t say no right now, and even if she could she didn’t have the brains to undo the complex interconnected changes she’d made to herself.</p>
<p>Why had she even wanted to do that, she wondered. She had been scared the changes were too much? Scared of this? This perfect feeling, this euphoria? Why? Why wouldn’t she want this? As her first orgasm overtook her, her mind completely came apart. She heard herself screaming “Yes, Daddy, fuck me!” but it was autonomic, there were no higher thoughts putting the words together. </p>
<p>The next time she was able to form a coherent thought, Daddy had moved her to the bedroom. How long had they been fucking? Only a few minutes, she thought. She was lying on her back, looking up at him as he thrust in and out of her.</p>
<p>“Daddy, it feels so good,” she heard herself say. Old Candice—the Software Engineer, the worrier, the planner—would have been analyzing this. She would have been wondering if the angle was right, if she was making the right noises, if he was enjoying it enough, if they should switch positions. </p>
<p>But as Richard drove into her, deeper and harder, she realized with a jolt of clarity that she wasn’t analyzing anything. She was just being. Why would she want to think when she could just feel? </p>
<p>“That’s my slut,” Richard said, smiling down at her. He grabbed her hair and kissed her deeply, his tongue exploring her mouth. He came inside her and Candy came again with him. Her mind scattered.</p>
<p>The next time she could assemble a coherent thought, she was sucking Richard off again. She vaguely remembered she’d given herself that power, the power to get any man hard with her mouth. She’d wanted to make sure Richard could keep up with her, to sate her deep well of sexual desire. Probably one of the changes she had been afraid of. At some point she’d put one of her new dildos in her pussy—she felt it buzzing away. She came again.</p>
<p>Now she was riding Richard. His cock was inside her, and she felt her tits bouncing. He groped at them roughly, pinching her nipples. Yes, this was who she was meant to be. Candice had started to think of herself and Candy as separate personas, and now she knew it was true. But that thought no longer held dread for her, it held promise.</p>
<p>“I’m going to cum in you, slut,” Richard said. “Do you want that? Do you want Daddy’s cum?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Daddy! Please!” she begged, arching her back and squeezing him tightly. She knew she was saying exactly what he wanted to hear, and she meant every word. She felt his cock begin to pulse, felt him unload inside her.</p>
<p>Candy didn’t cum, not this time. She writhed on him, dug her long, sharp nails into him, but held on. She didn’t want the release. Whenever Candy was satiated, Candice came back. But Candice was fearful, scared of her new self. Candy wanted to stay Candy a while longer. She collapsed on top of Richard, taking deep breaths, pretending she was coming down from an orgasm, but all she really felt was her hard nipples pressed against his chest, his cock softening inside her.</p>
<p>Richard kissed the top of her head. “You’re incredible, Candy. Absolutely incredible. You really blew my mind today. I’m so lucky to be married to you.”</p>
<p>Candy smiled, nuzzling into his neck. “I try, Daddy.” She lifted her head, looking at him with wide, adoring eyes. “I love making you happy. I want to be your perfect girl.”</p>
<p>“You are perfect,” he reassured her, stroking her blonde hair. He held her close for a moment longer, clearly savoring the aftermath. “This was an amazing surprise, Candice.” He chuckled. “I still can’t believe you went out in that tube top. When did you even get that?”</p>
<p>Candy laughed. “I bought it while I was out,” she lied, “and wore it home.”</p>
<p>He wrapped his arms around her. She loved feeling held and protected by him. That had been true even before all her changes, and doubly so now. “I bet everyone was staring at you,” he said.</p>
<p>“They were,” Candy answered, with a mischievous grin. “And I loved it. The girl that worked on my nails was bisexual, and kept staring at me. When I was done she gave me her number.”</p>
<p>Richard chuckled. “That’s my girl.”</p>
<p>“I told her I had a boyfriend, but I don’t think she cared. I’m pretty sure she’d be up for a threesome. What do you think?”</p>
<p>She felt Richard hold her a little tighter. “I don’t want to move too fast, Candice.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“With all this. This weekend has been… I mean, wow. But let’s not move too fast. Remember what happened to Justin when he and his wife opened up their marriage?” he asked. “Remember how they insisted they were a modern couple who didn’t need to be bound by traditional rules of monogamy? And now they’re divorced.”</p>
<p>“Daddy, that wouldn’t happen to us, I…”</p>
<p>“No,” he said, cutting her off. And that was that. When Daddy was firm, his word was law. “At least for the foreseeable future. Ask me again in a few months, if you still want to. OK, Candice?”</p>
<p>“OK, Daddy. And Daddy?”</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“Call me Candy.”</p>
<p>“OK, Candy,” he said, as he ran his fingers through her hair. They lay like that a while, his breathing getting heavier, until he was asleep.</p>
<p>Candy got up. She was still horny, and she had a very specific reason why she hadn’t let herself cum. She made her way to the office and opened the laptop. She had some changes to make. </p>
<p>Candice—the old her—had been right about one thing: she was too dumb when she came. Candy didn’t like losing her mind altogether, she wanted to experience Richard’s cock, not white out in bliss. She pulled up the complex “dumbification” settings she’d made earlier, and turned down the intelligence drain. But not all the way. After all, why would she want to go back to over-analyzing everything?</p>
<p>Next she opened her arousal curve settings. When she’d originally mapped out the arousal curve, Candice had made sure she could hit the highest of highs when she came, but still stay normal, unaroused in a day-to-day context. But why had she wanted that? Today, Candy had felt the constant crackle of sexual energy on the street. She’d been a little bit turned on the whole time and it had felt amazing. She turned up the beginning of the curve. Now it would take an ice bath, or deep meditation, or something similar to get her down to zero arousal. Otherwise she’d always be a little aroused, which meant a little air-headed. And why not? She didn’t need to be Smart Candice anymore, she had Master PC. Why worry and stress and try to climb the corporate ladder the hard way when she could just float through life?</p>
<p>A little voice inside her was screaming, terrified. But Candy wouldn’t have to hear that voice much longer. Candice was the old self, and Candy was the new, improved version. She was changing, metamorphing or whatever it was called. A caterpillar didn’t know what it was meant to be. It just munched on dirt until one day it became a butterfly. Were caterpillars afraid of changing? </p>
<p>Candice had been planning on undoing so many changes. Her boring old self had been about to stop the transformation. The caterpillar was trying to claw the butterfly back into the cocoon. Candy wasn’t going to let that happen.</p>
<p>That metaphor doesn’t even make sense, a little part of her brain said, the part that still wanted to be Candice. But it was small and Candy ignored it as she clicked “Apply.”</p>
<hr/>
<p>The rest of the weekend passed in a blur. Richard woke up from his nap and insisted on taking Candy out on the town. They hit the bars and clubs downtown, and never had to wait in line. Candy wore a “club dress” she’d bought at the adult store. It was shiny silver and had a V so deep it went past her navel. It required some expertly applied boob tape, but fortunately that had been sold right next to the dress. Daddy loved it, and so did Candy.</p>
<p>Everywhere they went, people stared. Candy felt their eyes on her and she preened, soaking up the attention like sunlight. She’d always hated being the center of attention, but now she was obsessed with it. It wasn’t just the men either. Women looked at her too, some with envy, others with a kind of awe. She felt like a celebrity, a walking monument to female sexuality.</p>
<p>Richard was beaming all night. Sometimes he’d walk away for a little bit ostensibly to get drinks, but really to let other guys hit on her. She could tell how much he loved it when he’d walk back and put his arm around her, seeing the jealousy and defeat in those other men’s faces. He introduced her to everyone as “Candy,” and his eyes never left her. When they were alone for a moment, he leaned in and whispered, “I feel like the luckiest man alive.” Candy kissed him, her entire focus on pleasing him, on being the trophy he deserved.</p>
<p>She took a ton of selfies through the night, posting them with cute captions. Even a few TikToks, and she’d never actually posted to TikTok before. Every time she did, there were new followers and a lot of new comments. She liked them all, reveling in the validation.</p>
<p>They didn’t make it home until the early hours of the morning. After another quickie, they both passed out in the bed together.</p>
<p>The next day was Sunday, and they took it a bit easier. Candy alleviated the worst of their hangovers with Master PC and aside from heading out for lunch (she wore some cute short-shorts and a crop top) they spent the day inside chilling and watching Netflix. </p>
<p>Candy texted River, letting her know another meeting would have to wait. The nail tech asked if they could just meet in secret, without Richard. Candy considered it—she wasn’t against it in principle, but Daddy had said no, and that was that. She let River down as easily as she could and decided to make it up to her by enhancing the girl a little with Master PC.</p>
<p>Richard did a little more gaming and Candy enjoyed just being in his company, curled up with him on the couch and feeling his presence next to her. Whenever she felt like she was losing her little high of arousal, she would press her thighs together, or idly play with her pussy. Even with the nails, she found if she was careful she could get one finger inside herself.</p>
<p>They made idle chit-chat, talking about how exciting the past few days had been, planning what new adventures they might go on and how best to explore this new side of Candice. Towards the end of the day, Daddy’s talk turned to boring stuff. He was excited about some new idea he had at work, something about how to do financial analytics at the bank he worked at. He asked her a few times if Candy could help him code it. It was the kind of problem that would have fascinated Candice before, but Candy found it kind of boring now. She gave a few vague answers and gave him a blow job instead when he wouldn’t shut up about it.</p>
<p>As she licked and sucked, Candy knew that Candice was gone. The caterpillar was no more, only the butterfly remained. And Daddy’s cock was her honey, or whatever it was butterflies ate. She was Daddy’s perfect slut, and she was home. Sucking harder, she pulled him toward release, a feeling of contentment washing over her. This was everything.</p>
<p>They drink nectar, idiot, a little voice in her head said. Well, maybe Candice wasn’t completely gone. But Daddy came in her mouth and that was enough to silence the voice for now.</p>
