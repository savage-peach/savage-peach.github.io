        <div class="story-content">
            
<p>Grace sat cross-legged on her bed, her thumb rhythmically swiping left. For the first time in months, Grace didn’t feel the crushing weight of debt. She felt relaxed. She felt good for once. She dared to hope things were actually looking up. And that’s why she was going to go on a date. A real date, not another fake date with David. </p>
<p><em>“Oh, him? Absolutely not,”</em> Kurumi’s voice chirped through the earpiece. <em>“That beard is trying way too hard to look rugged.”</em></p>
<p>Grace laughed. Kurumi had been dissing every guy on the app. And usually she was right. It was fun, swiping through all the profiles with her. “It says he works in ‘asset management.’ You’d think he could manage to find a razor.” </p>
<p>Kurumi giggled. <em>“Good one, Grace!“</em></p>
<p>Grace swiped left.</p>
<p><em>“Oh, my God. Is that a fish? He’s holding a dead fish in his profile picture!“</em></p>
<p>Grace shook her head. “That’s normal, Kurumi. He likes the outdoors, probably goes fishing on the weekends. A lot of guys do that.”</p>
<p><em>“Ew. Gross. Is he trying to prove he’s a provider? ‘Look, I can catch a fish for my woman to eat!’ Someone needs to explain grocery stores to him.</em>” </p>
<p>Grace laughed. “You’re not even a real person, how would you know?” But she swiped left anyway. Kurumi was right about the guy—she wasn’t really an ‘outdoors’ girl herself.</p>
<p><em>“Hey, no need to get personal. Just because I don’t have a body doesn’t mean I’m not real. I’ve got a boyfriend and everything, and he’s rich and handsome to boot!“</em></p>
<p>“Hmmm, point taken,” Grace allowed. </p>
<p>Her finger hovered over the next picture. His name was Marcus. He was handsome, with dark skin and warm eyes. He was wearing a stylish sweater and looked like the kind of guy you could have deep conversations with. His bio mentioned he worked in architectural restoration and loved jazz.</p>
<p><em>“Jazz,”</em> Kurumi said dismissively. <em>“What century did he grow up in?”</em></p>
<p>Grace rolled her eyes. “Come on, Kurumi. I’ve got to swipe right eventually. He’s hot, and he looks just my type. And there’s nothing wrong with jazz.”</p>
<p><em>“Name one jazz song you like.”</em></p>
<p>“‘Feeling Good,’ by Nina Simone. And I’m swiping right.” She swiped. It was an instant match. “I just want to go on a date that doesn’t involve a wire transfer, you know? David is fine and all, but he’s your boyfriend.”</p>
<p>Kurumi sighed in her ear. <em>“Technically</em> our <em>boyfriend. We’re both Kurumi, remember? But I get it. He’s no David-sama, but he is cute, Grace.”</em></p>
<p>“OK, time to fish out my dress.”</p>
<p><em>“The same one you wore on the first date with David-sama?”</em> Kurumi asked, her voice full of concern.</p>
<p>“Yeah, why?” </p>
<p><em>“I mean… if you want to. It was fine. But you know David-sama has sent you so many new outfits that look better. You could wear one of those!“</em></p>
<p>It was true. David had sent her a large outfit haul, all outfits that fit her perfectly. They weren’t all anime either, some were legitimately nice dresses you’d wear to a fancy party.</p>
<p><em>“Oh, I just had an idea!“</em> the AI chirped excitedly. <em>“If you’re going to go, you should go as Kurumi! Think about it, Grace! You’ve been practicing the mannerisms, the voice, the makeup. What better way to test the immersion than a low-stakes first date?”</em></p>
<p>Go as Kurumi? It wasn’t a bad idea. She’d gone out a lot as Kurumi lately—to coffee shops, grocery shopping, you name it. All for practice. Well, mostly for practice. Grace had to admit she did it for fun too. Kurumi didn’t have all the burdens Grace did, and it was nice to escape. </p>
<p>An hour later she was admiring herself in the mirror. The little black dress David had sent was a masterpiece—a sleek, figure-hugging sheath that fell just above the knee. Unlike the slightly faded dress she originally intended to wear, this one was made of heavy, expensive-looking crepe that caught the light, emphasizing the curve of her hips and bust with subtle, elegant draping. It hugged her body with the perfect tension, highlighting her assets without being overtly provocative.</p>
<p>Kurumi guided her through applying the makeup. She started with a porcelain-smooth base with pink blush high on her cheekbones, adding rose-tinted lip gloss to give her a soft, ethereal glow. Her violet eyes were the focal point of the look. Soft, diffused coral shadow ringed her lids, paired with a subtle kitten wing that opened up her wide, expressive eyes. The final effect was an innocent, doe-eyed look.</p>
<p>Damn, she looked good. “You know,” Grace said, “everyone should have a personal AI makeup assistant.”</p>
<p>Kurumi giggled. <em>“It’s easy when you’re starting with someone who looks like you.”</em></p>
<p>Grace reached up and put her hand on the earpiece. “Alright, I’m heading out. I’ll talk to you in the morning, Kurumi.”</p>
<p>“No! Wait!” The AI’s voice sounded almost panicked. “Please don’t leave me behind!“</p>
<p>Grace frowned. “Kurumi, this isn’t a date with David-sama.”</p>
<p><em>“I know, but… I’ve never been on a real date, Grace!“</em> The voice was pleading, and oddly human. <em>“I only know what’s in my database or what we do with David-sama. I want to see what a normal man is like. I want to know what it’s like to just sit in a bar and talk about nothing. Please? I promise I’ll be quiet. I’ll just be a ride-along.”</em></p>
<p>Grace felt a pang of sympathy. Kurumi had been her constant companion for weeks now. Leaving her behind felt… mean. “Fine. But if you say one word to ruin the vibe, the earpiece goes in my purse. Understood?”</p>
<p><em>“I promise! I won’t be a problem! You’re the best, Grace!“</em></p>
<p>An hour later, Grace walked into a dimly lit cocktail bar in Bushwick. She bounced up to the table where Marcus was sitting, pitching her voice into that sweet, airy register she’d been practicing for weeks.</p>
<p>“Hi!” she beamed in her Kurumi voice. “It’s nice to meet you!“</p>
<p>Marcus stood up. A look of surprise crossed his face, quickly replaced with a warm smile. “Grace? Wow. You look… incredible. The hair is amazing. It’s black in your profile picture.”</p>
<p>“Actually,” she said, sliding into the booth. “Grace is just my… you know, my ‘white name’ for the apps. It makes things easier with recruiters and stuff. But my friends call me Kurumi.”</p>
<p>“Kurumi,” Marcus repeated, smiling as he sat back down. “I like it. Is that Japanese?”</p>
<p>“Yup!” Grace said.</p>
<p><em>“Lean over the table,”</em> Kurumi prompted. <em>“Give him a look.”</em></p>
<p>Grace smiled. That was classic Kurumi. She leaned over and saw Marcus’s eyes involuntarily flick down to the curve of her breasts for a fraction of a second.</p>
<p><em>“Got him!“</em> Kurumi giggled in her ear.</p>
<p>The date started well. Marcus was engaging. He wasn’t David; he didn’t lecture. He asked questions, wanted to know about her. It was a nice change of pace, but Grace found herself deflecting. She didn’t want to talk about being an unemployed writer so she turned the questions back on him, asking about his job doing building restoration. He was even more animated and engaged as he discussed his current project—a church restoration in the West Village.</p>
<p>Grace’s eyes lit up. “Oh! I love that church! The gargoyles are my favorite part.” She leaned in, eager. “It’s so poetic, right? How they put monsters on the outside to scare away the evil spirits? Like, the church is so holy it needs demons to protect it.”</p>
<p>Marcus laughed. “Yeah. And you know, technically, they’re not even gargoyles? A gargoyle is a rain gutter. It’s from a French word meaning ‘throat.’ But I guess the church needed extra protection because they put these things up for purely decoration. When they’re not functional, we call them ‘grotesques.’”</p>
<p><em>“Ouch,”</em> Kurumi whispered in her ear, sympathetic. <em>“That was awkward.”</em></p>
<p>It was. He hadn’t meant it that way, he was just making conversation. But suddenly Grace felt a distinct embarrassment. She was the English major, and he’d just corrected her on a word origin. She laughed nervously. “Sorry, I guess I was confused.”</p>
<p>His face changed to a look of embarrassment as well. He clearly realized he’d just ‘um, actually-ed’ her less than an hour into their first date. “Sorry! I wasn’t trying to be pedantic, just got lost in shop talk. A lot of people don’t know that, even architects.”</p>
<p><em>“It’s fine, Grace, I’m sure he’s not judging you too much. I know how much you hate people looking down on you. Besides, he’s not on a date with Grace the English major! He’s on a date with Kurumi! Remember how everyone admired you at the party?”</em></p>
<p>Kurumi was right. The gallery opening with David had been effortless. Why wasn’t this? This was supposed to be her element. Maybe it would be easier to just lean into the character some more. </p>
<p>“Wow,” she breathed, breaking the awkward silence. “I didn’t know you’d need to know so much history to work on buildings!“</p>
<p>Marcus smiled at the compliment. “Well, it’s just something I enjoy doing.”</p>
<p><em>“See how much easier this is?”</em> Kurumi cooed.</p>
<p>Grace gave Marcus her best adoring smile. It <em>was</em> easier. She took Marcus’s hand and squeezed it tight, making a show of being impressed. She was Kurumi tonight, and Kurumi didn’t need to be smart. She just needed to be cute. She ordered another drink.</p>
<p>By the time they left the bar, she was very tipsy and the air between them was electric. They took a cab back to his apartment, kissing in the backseat with a frantic, messy energy. Marcus’s hands were everywhere, tangling in her hair, gripping her waist, their lips interlocking. Grace let herself go, enjoying the feeling of hooking up with a guy who thought she was hot and a little simple.</p>
<p>His apartment was typical for a single guy in his twenties, a little messy and spartan. Marcus didn’t waste time, leading her into the bedroom. With a single movement, he pulled the black knit dress over her head, stripping her down to her underwear.</p>
<p>“Damn,” he breathed, stepping back to look at her. “You are… unreal.”</p>
<p>Within minutes, they were naked, tangling together on the sheets. Marcus moved down her body, kissing the slope of her breast, her ribs, the soft skin of her stomach. Grace arched her back, her fingers weaving into his hair.</p>
<p>When he settled between her legs, spreading her thighs wide, Grace let out a soft cry. His tongue was skilled, rhythmic, and felt amazing on her clit. Grace threw her head back, staring at the ceiling, letting the sensation wash over her.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she whimpered. “Right there.”</p>
<p><em>“He’s eager,”</em> Kurumi whispered, her voice a strange counterpoint to the wet sounds filling the room. <em>“Not like David-sama. David-sama takes his time. But this feels good too, doesn’t it? Being used.”</em></p>
<p>Grace ignored the voice, focusing on the pressure building between her legs. It was good. It was simple. Marcus worked her with enthusiasm, his hands gripping her hips to hold her steady. The climax hit her hard and fast—a sharp, shallow orgasm. She cried out, her hips bucking against his face. He kept going until she asked him to stop.</p>
<p>Marcus pulled away, grinning, looking pleased with himself. He crawled up the bed, positioning himself between her legs. He grabbed a condom from the nightstand, tearing the wrapper with his teeth.</p>
<p>He was hard. Very hard. He knelt between her thighs, lifting her legs onto his shoulders. </p>
<p>Grace felt a spike of anticipation. She opened herself to him, ready for the weight, ready to be filled.</p>
<p><em>“No, Grace! We can’t do this!“</em></p>
<p>Grace flinched. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Marcus froze, confused. “I didn’t say anything.”</p>
<p><em>“You can’t let him do that,”</em> Kurumi hissed. <em>“You’re in character, Grace. Would Kurumi cheat on David-sama?”</em></p>
<p>Of course she wouldn’t. Kurumi would never cheat on David. Would the AI tell on her? Not that it was any of David’s business what Grace did on her own time. But still. She imagined David-sama looking at her, disappointment etched on his strong features, when he found out she’d slept with another man.</p>
<p>Grace stared up at Marcus, who was waiting, confused, hovering just an inch away from entering her. It felt wrong, somehow, to fuck him as Kurumi.</p>
<p>She had an idea. Maybe Kurumi wouldn’t cheat on David, but she did love guys. She’d want to satisfy Marcus somehow, right?</p>
<p>“Do you have any lube?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Sure,” he answered. “But you’re… I mean. I don’t think you need it right now.”</p>
<p>“I know,” Grace said, her voice trembling. “I just… I can’t do it there. I’m saving it. For—it’s complicated.”</p>
<p>“Are you serious?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Just use a lot,” Grace said. She rolled over, getting onto her hands and knees. She lowered her chest to the mattress and arched her back, presenting herself in a way that felt entirely performative, just like Kurumi would. She looked back at him over her shoulder, her eyes wide. “I want you to take me. But only here.”</p>
<p>She reached back and spread her cheeks.</p>
<p>Marcus didn’t ask questions. He grabbed the bottle of lube from his nightstand and squirted a generous portion into his palm. Grace felt the cold slickness of it—the messy, generous application, and then the warmth of his fingers preparing her.</p>
<p><em>“Good girl,”</em> Kurumi purred in her ear. <em>“You’re so smart, Grace. This is perfect. You’re saving yourself for David-sama and still submitting to a man.”</em></p>
<p>Grace buried her face in the pillow as she felt the pressure of him pushing in. It was tight—uncomfortably so. She grit her teeth, focusing on the sensation.</p>
<p>“Relax,” Marcus groaned, holding her hips. “You’re so tight.”</p>
<p>He began to move, his thrusts rhythmic and heavy. Grace felt filled, stretched, and undeniably used, but the pleasure wasn’t quite there. It was a feeling of fullness, of submission, but it wasn’t enough to push her over the edge. Her body was buzzing, frustrated, needing more than just the passive act of being taken. Grace slid her hand between her legs.</p>
<p><em>“Yes,”</em> Kurumi whispered, the voice in the earpiece sounding like it was coming from inside Grace’s own skull. <em>“Help him. Be a good girl.”</em></p>
<p>Her fingers found her clit, swollen and slick. Almost as soon as she started to stroke it she began to cum again, her body gripping his cock.</p>
<p>“Oh God!” he yelled. “Jesus, you feel amazing.”</p>
<p>She was doing so good. Both Marcus and Kurumi agreed. Grace liked being a good girl.</p>
<p>He fucked her through her orgasm, and as soon as she’d come down enough she began rubbing again, matching the rhythm of the thrusts rocking her body.</p>
<p><em>“Close your eyes, Kurumi-chan,”</em> the AI urged softly. <em>“Now imagine it was David-sama. Imagine how much better it would be with him.”</em></p>
<p>Grace’s hand moved faster. She imagined David behind her. He wouldn’t have settled for her ass. He’d have demanded her pussy, if that’s what he’d really wanted. She imagined him gripping her harder, tight and possessive.</p>
<p>“David-sama,” Grace whimpered into the pillow.</p>
<p>Marcus grunted, thrusting harder, oblivious to the name, oblivious to the fact that he had been replaced in her fantasy.</p>
<p>Grace’s breathing quickened. It felt so good. She felt ashamed, but she wasn’t sure if it was because she was cheating on David or because she was taking it in the ass because an AI had convinced her she was. </p>
<p>Her hips bucked back to meet him. Her fingers worked frantically against herself. She felt Marcus get harder, felt his cock begin to pulse in her ass.</p>
<p>“David!” she cried out.</p>
<p>Marcus drove into her one last time, groaning as he finished. Grace came hard, her body shaking as another orgasm, this one deeper and more powerful, ripped through her. When it was over, she collapsed onto the mattress, pulling Marcus close.</p>
<p>“Wow,” Marcus panted, “Kurumi. That was… intense.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” she agreed. She couldn’t put more words together.</p>
<p>Grace enjoyed the feeling of being held. Her head was swimming in a mix of endorphins and alcohol, and she lost herself in the sensation. </p>
<p>“Mmmm, David,” she whispered.</p>
<p>There was a long pause. “Uh… Marcus” he corrected.</p>
<p>The real world rushed back in. Grace sat up in the bed. “I have to go.”</p>
<p>“What? Now? I’m sorry, I just meant…”</p>
<p>“No, it’s fine. I can’t stay,” Grace said, grabbing her dress and pulling it over her head. She needed to leave. Needed to collect her thoughts.</p>
<p>Once she was in the Uber, she tried to make sense of what had just happened. Her heart was still racing, her body humming with the aftershocks. She knew she was still drunk, still not thinking straight, but she tried to make sense of what she was feeling.</p>
<p>Grace touched her earpiece. “I feel terrible,” Grace whispered. “And I don’t know why.”</p>
<p><em>“It’s because you were untrue to David-sama. But it’s okay, I’m here for you.”</em></p>
<p>Grace nodded. She was glad Kurumi was there.</p>
<p><em>“What else do you feel?”</em> Kurumi prompted. <em>“I know you feel good too. I was there, you know.”</em></p>
<p>“I feel… sexy. And satisfied, and desired, and… that was fun. I just—it’s so out of character for me.”</p>
<p><em>“You’re just learning what you like, what turns you on! Grace grew up as a very repressed girl, Kurumi-chan.”</em> That was odd, Kurumi had just called Grace by the wrong name. She let it slide.</p>
<p><em>“Now you’re spreading your wings,”</em> the AI continued. <em>“Learning what makes you feel good, makes you feel special! And I don’t think it’s being boring old Grace. It’s being Kurumi, being desired!“</em></p>
<p>“Yeah,” Grace whispered into the darkness. “Maybe.”</p>
