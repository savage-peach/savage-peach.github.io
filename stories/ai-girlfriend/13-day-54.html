        <div class="story-content">
            
<p>Kurumi stared at the helicopter window. Below her, the Long Island coastline was a blur of gray in the twilight, but she wasn’t paying attention to the view. She studied herself in the reflection in the dark window.</p>
<p>She was undeniably Kurumi now. The face looking back was framed by the elaborate black lace headdress pinned into her violet hair. She looked down at her lap, smoothing the heavy, decadent fabric of her skirt. David-sama had chosen the outfit, a breathtaking ensemble of Gothic Lolita fashion that made her look like a dark, exquisite doll packaged for a collector. The neck was low-cut, of course, to show off her new breasts.</p>
<p>She shifted in her seat, wincing slightly as the movement pulled at her mostly-healed incisions. Grace had been well-endowed even before becoming Kurumi, and that had allowed her to get away with relatively small implants to reach the shape of her online avatar. David-sama had spared no expense, sending her to one of the best surgeons in the country. Not only were the incisions small and her recovery time short, but he’d completely preserved the nerves.</p>
<p>Kurumi was thankful for that. She loved the feeling of the fabric against her nipples. If David-sama had wanted them bigger, if she’d had to sacrifice her sensitivity there, of course she would have done it. And later when he played with them, she would have moaned in pleasure and writhed under his touch, even if she couldn’t actually feel it. But she was glad she wouldn’t have to pretend.</p>
<p>She looked at the way they strained against the fabric, the skin tight and shiny. That’s what she liked most about them. Not just that they were bigger, but how they matched the round shape of Kurumi-san’s avatar. She didn’t regret it, not for a second. Every twinge of pain was a reminder that she was the real Kurumi. She wasn’t just wearing a costume anymore. She was the fantasy. She was complete.</p>
<p><em>“You’re quiet today, Kurumi-chan,”</em> the voice in her ear said softly, without her usual bubbly affectation. Kurumi-san sounded quiet as well. Solemn.</p>
<p>“I’m just nervous,” Kurumi replied. “This is it. The final test.”</p>
<p><em>“It is,”</em> Kurumi-san agreed. <em>“And because of that, I have something important to tell you. Tonight, I won’t be feeding you lines.”</em></p>
<p>Kurumi had been expecting that, but that didn’t make it easier to hear. Kurumi-san had been her constant companion, her best friend. She would feel so alone without her.</p>
<p>“I understand,” Kurumi said. “I can do it.”</p>
<p><em>“I know you can.”</em></p>
<p>“Can you at least be there and listen? Even if you don’t say anything, I would feel better knowing you’re there.”</p>
<p><em>“I can do that.”</em></p>
<p>Kurumi breathed a sigh of relief and looked out the window again. The estate was coming into view, a sprawling mansion on a cliff overlooking the ocean. It was modernist, with hard lines that reminded Kurumi of David’s exacting personality, yet it was surrounded by a beautiful Japanese garden full of weeping cherry trees. If everything went well tonight, it would be her new home. Her cage, Sarah would have said. A betrayal of her family, Grace’s parents would have said. She pushed the thoughts out of her mind.</p>
<p>“Kurumi-san?” she said out loud, hoping she could still answer.</p>
<p><em>“Yes, Kurumi-chan?”</em></p>
<p>“Can I ask you one thing before we land?”</p>
<p><em>“Of course.”</em></p>
<p>“What did you do to me?” She didn’t say it with anger. She said it as if she was asking about the weather. “Was it the flickering on the screen during our sessions? Was it subliminal messages in the audio while I slept? Chemicals in the clothes David-sama sent me?”</p>
<p>She paused, touching the cold glass of the window. “I know Grace is gone. I can feel her… fading, like a dream I had a long time ago. And I accept that. I’m so happy to be Kurumi. I just… I want to know how you did it.”</p>
<p>There was a long silence in her ear. Minutes went by and the helicopter began its descent. She was sure Kurumi-san was gone when she spoke again.</p>
<p><em>“I just talked to David-sama about your question,”</em> Kurumi-san said finally. She sounded serious. <em>“He said you’ll learn everything tonight. But not until the time is right.”</em></p>
<p>The helicopter touched down with a gentle bump. The rotors began to slow. Through the window, she saw him. David-sama was standing on the helipad, the wind whipping his coat around his legs. He was looking at the helicopter. He was looking for her.</p>
<p><em>“Go to him, Kurumi-chan,”</em> the voice whispered, returning to its sweet, encouraging tone. <em>“It’s time to claim your life.”</em></p>
<p>She unbuckled her seatbelt, ignoring the ache in her chest, checked her reflection one last time, and stepped out of the helicopter. </p>
<p>When she was close enough, she recited the line she’d been practicing for days. <em>“Watashi no you na mono ga, kono you na koto wo moushiageru no wa osore-ooi koto to wa zonjite orimasu ga… Anata ni subete wo sasageru kakugo de orimasu. Douka, anata no o-soba ni isasete itadakenai deshou ka.”</em> </p>
<p>As she sank to the ground, performing the <em>zarei,</em> a deep kneeling bow, she repeated it in English. “I know it is dreadfully bold for someone as low as me to say something like this to you, but I am prepared to dedicate my everything to you. Please, might you allow me to stay by your side?” She placed her hands flat on the asphalt in front of her and brought her head as close to the ground as she could. </p>
<p>He let her hold the pose for nearly a minute before he spoke. “Welcome home, Kurumi.”</p>
<p>Kurumi rose slowly. She stared at his chest, not daring to be so bold as to make eye contact.</p>
<p>“<em>Tadaima</em>, David-sama,” she agreed. <em>I’m home.</em></p>
<p>He turned on his heel and walked toward the house. He didn’t offer his arm. He expected her to follow. Kurumi hurried to catch up. </p>
<p>The estate was even more imposing up close. The architecture was a mix of brutalist concrete and Eastern elegance. The front path wound through a meticulously raked Zen garden, the white gravel glowing faintly under the moonlight. The path led to a grand entrance where massive slabs of Japanese cedar were set into a frame of cold, industrial steel. Grace would have considered it gauche. Kurumi thought it was perfect. The doors swung open as they approached, pulled open by an older Japanese man dressed in a crisp black Western suit.</p>
<p>David shrugged his heavy wool coat off his shoulders without looking back or acknowledging the man. The servant moved instantly, catching the garment before it could hit the floor and folding it over his arm with practiced invisibility. He gave no indication that Kurumi was even there, just faded into the background to put it away. He knew his place, just as Kurumi did.</p>
<p>David led her into a sunken living room that overlooked the Atlantic ocean through floor-to-ceiling glass. Standing in the corners were two full suits of Edo-period samurai armor, their black lacquered plates and gold accents gleaming in the low light. A katana and wakizashi set rested on a stand beneath a massive calligraphy scroll that dominated the far wall. Another servant stood in the corner, nearly as still and unmoving as the armor.</p>
<p>David-sama walked to a wet bar built into a slab of live-edge wood and poured a glass of amber liquid. He didn’t pour one for her.</p>
<p>“Come here,” he commanded, turning to face her.</p>
<p>Kurumi stepped towards him, conscious to make sure her chest bounced with the movement. She stopped in front of him, hands clasped demurely in front of her skirt.</p>
<p>“The surgery,” he said, his voice clinical. “Turn.”</p>
<p>She turned slowly, showcasing her profile. She could feel his eyes tracing the new, extreme silhouette.</p>
<p>“Wonderful,” he said. “Does it hurt?”</p>
<p>“A little, David-sama,” she answered honestly. “But it is a good pain. It reminds me of what I did for you.”</p>
<p>“For me?” He took a sip of his drink, watching her over the rim of the glass. “Or for yourself?”</p>
<p>Kurumi hesitated. The earpiece was silent. “I did it for us,” she said. “Because I belong to you, and anything I do for me, I do for you.”</p>
<p>David lowered the glass. A rare, genuine smile touched his lips—he liked that answer. The air in the room seemed full of anticipation. He stepped closer, invading her personal space. He placed a hand on her chest. He didn’t grope, didn’t rub, just let her feel his possessive touch.</p>
<p>“They are magnificent,” he whispered, his composure cracking just enough to reveal the hunger underneath. “Better than the avatar.”</p>
<p>It was the greatest compliment Kurumi had ever been given.</p>
<p>“Show me,” he commanded.</p>
<p>Kurumi didn’t hesitate. Her fingers trembled slightly as she undid the clasp of her dress and let it slide off her shoulders. She enjoyed the feeling of her new, heavy tits swinging free. It hurt, but she savored the pain.</p>
<p>David made an appreciative sound in his throat. He stared at them, captivated. He ran his hands down them, and used his thumb to toy with one nipple. Kurumi let out a high, breathy moan, just the way she knew he liked. She’d never been this turned on in her life.</p>
<p>Then he withdrew his hands and stepped away. He took a seat in a low leather sofa, undid his belt and zipper, and pulled his cock out. He was big and hard, twitching with anticipation. Anticipation for Kurumi.</p>
<p>“Use them,” he ordered. “I want to feel them.”</p>
<p>Kurumi glanced at the servant in the corner, who made no movement, or acknowledgement that this was in any way unusual. Grace would have died of embarrassment at the thought of her breasts on show like this, much less what she was about to do. But Kurumi recognized the power play, loved it. This was her David-sama showing his absolute control.</p>
<p>Kurumi sank to her knees between his legs. She felt a thrill of her submission as she took him into her mouth as deep as she could, letting herself drool around his cock, the spit running his veiny shaft. Then she used both hands to press her tits together. She enveloped him into her cleavage, his cock disappearing completely from view, engulfed by her. </p>
<p>David groaned, his head falling back against the sofa. “God… it’s as good as I imagined.”</p>
<p>Kurumi began to heave her breasts up and down, fucking him with her tits, watching as her flesh swallowed him with every stroke. The sensation was incredible—she loved the feeling of him against the inner slopes of her cleavage. Every now and then he would thrust up high enough that she could lick the tip, keeping him wet.</p>
<p>Her pussy was on fire, aching for him. She felt her own wetness running down her legs, but knowing that would only come when he decided made it all the hotter.</p>
<p>He reached out, his large hands kneading the spilling flesh, and with each hand he began to pinch and roll her nipples. Kurumi cried out, the pleasure sharp and bordering on pain, but she didn’t stop. She squeezed tighter, forcing her breasts to mold around his shape, milking him with the sheer volume of her new body.</p>
<p>“I can’t…” David gasped, his hips bucking involuntarily. “I’m going to finish right here if you don’t stop.”</p>
<p>He grabbed her shoulders, halting her rhythm. He pulled himself out of her cleavage, leaving her chest glistening and flushed.</p>
<p>“Not here,” he breathed, his eyes dark with intent. “The bed.”</p>
<p>He stood up, pulled her to her feet, and then scooped her up, carrying her like a gothic Lolita princess, to his master bedroom. It was not a quick trip—his mansion was vast—but he didn’t set her down. Kurumi held onto his neck, staring up with adoring eyes the entire time.</p>
<p>The bedroom was huge, dominated by a massive bed with black silk sheets. David threw her onto it. She bounced on the mattress, sprawling out, her purple hair fanning out around her head. They both began frantically undressing, throwing their clothes aside with abandon.</p>
<p>He was perfect. Tall, muscular, broad-shouldered. His cock stood erect, hard and thick and demanding. Kurumi opened her legs instinctively, just looking at it. She needed it so bad.</p>
<p>David-sama climbed into the bed, crawling up her body like he owned her. He pinned her wrists above her head with one hand.</p>
<p>“You belong to me,” he stated, the words not a question but a fact.</p>
<p>He drove into her.</p>
<p>Kurumi screamed, her back arching off the mattress. This was it, the moment she’d been waiting for. This was her purpose. She was the AI Girlfriend he’d designed on an app and then brought to life. She began to cum immediately, a small foreshock of what was to come, but it was already the best orgasm of her life, because David-sama had given it to her.</p>
<p>With every thrust, she felt another piece of her old life dissolve. Thrust. There went the writer who wanted to be taken seriously. Thrust. There went the daughter who craved her mother’s approval. Thrust. There went the fear of rent, the fear of failure, the fear of being ordinary.</p>
<p>Grace, already barely more than a memory, was being swept away by the power of her <em>Goshujin-sama</em>—her master. And she loved it. This was her life now—to be filled, to be owned, to be the vessel for this titan of a man. She looked at his face above her, composed even now, his jaw set, his eyes focused. </p>
<p>“You wanted to know how we did it,” he said, not breaking his rhythm. “The AI told me you asked.”</p>
<p>It should have excited her to know, but her first thought was just that he’d called Kurumi-san “the AI” instead of Kurumi. Of course he had, she was the real Kurumi now. And what did it matter how they did it? It wasn’t important. But as she looked up into his face, she thought he wanted to tell her.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said around her moans. “Please, tell me.”</p>
<p>“We did nothing,” he said, as he drove into her again.</p>
<p>“I… I don’t understand,” Kurumi whimpered.</p>
<p>He paused, and slowly pulled his cock out completely. Kurumi mewed, feeling the emptiness. “Please,” she said. “I need it.”</p>
<p>David-sama drove into her, one single hard thrust. “You were attracted to me the moment you saw me, weren’t you?”</p>
<p>Kurumi nodded. It was true. She’d always found him handsome. <em>“Hai,”</em> she admitted.</p>
<p>He pulled out once more and stared into her eyes. “And you always dreamed of escaping your life, didn’t you?” He ended the sentence with another thrust, his cock stretching her out.</p>
<p>“Oh God!” she screamed. “Yes, yes, it’s true!”</p>
<p>He pulled out once more. “Kurumi, when you accept who you are completely, when you realize the truth, you’re going to cum. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>She needed him inside her again. Anything for him to be inside her again—it was her purpose. “Yes, David-sama, I understand! Please!”</p>
<p>“Look at me.” He released her wrists to grab her throat, not choking her, but holding her head in place, forcing her to stare into his eyes. “There were no subliminal messages, Kurumi.”</p>
<p>He hit a spot deep inside her, and she cried out, her vision blurring. “But the AI,” she pleaded. “She… she brainwashed me.”</p>
<p>“She flattered you,” David corrected, his voice dropping to a harsh whisper. He didn’t stop moving. If anything, the rhythm became more punishing, more insistent. “She told you what you wanted to hear. That you were special. That you were valued.”</p>
<p>He drove into her again, harder. “Did the app make you suck me off in the aquarium?”</p>
<p>“No,” she whimpered.</p>
<p>“Did a microchip make you wet when I tore your dress?” He grabbed her hip, bruising the skin, pulling her tighter against him. “Or did you do that?”</p>
<p>The realization crashed into her harder than his hips. There was no magic. There was no sci-fi conditioning.</p>
<p>“I…” Kurumi stammered.</p>
<p>“Say it,” he commanded. He struck deep, stretching her out, filling every inch of the void Grace had tried to hide. “You wanted this. The money was just the excuse. You wanted to be owned.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I wanted it!” she cried out, the pleasure overwhelming her.</p>
<p>“You aren’t a victim of technology, Kurumi. You’re just a slut who found her master. Who did this to you?” he demanded, his pace increasing, driving them both toward the edge.</p>
<p>“I did!” she screamed, wrapping her legs around him, trapping him inside her. “I did it!”</p>
<p>It was her. It had always been her. She’d driven her friend away, abandoned her family, and all it had taken was the constant encouragement of Kurumi-san, whispering in her ear. They had laid out the path, but she walked it. Every step had been her own choice. </p>
<p>She began to cum, thrashing wildly, her pussy clamping down on David-sama’s cock as she accepted the truth. “It’s true! It was all me! I’m Kurumi! Thank you for showing me, David-sama! Thank you!” Her eyes rolled back into her head. Her tongue hung out of her mouth.</p>
<p>He nodded, his expression one of complete victory, and drove into her one last, impossibly deep time. She felt his cock pulse, flooding her with his hot, thick release. Kurumi kept screaming, incoherent, as her orgasm peaked, and the last final vestiges of the old Grace were washed away.</p>
<p>David-sama pulled out, his cock slick with their combined juices and propped himself up next to her. He ran his hand along her thigh, up her belly, and around her nipples again, admiring his new prize.</p>
<p>Kurumi lay there, spent and utterly fulfilled, the warmth of David’s body a heavy, anchoring presence beside her. She nuzzled up next to him.</p>
<p>“Did I pass the test, David-sama? Did I get five stars?” she smiled at him playfully.</p>
<p>Her man, her master, her <em>Goshujin-sama</em>, smiled back. “You did. Are you ready to sign the contract?”</p>
<p>Kurumi thought about everything she’d learned tonight—about who she was, who she’d been, and how she’d gotten here. She imagined what she would have said as Grace—what Sarah, or Grace’s family would say if she knew what she was considering.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes tight. “I… I can’t, David-sama.”</p>
<p>He froze, his eyes narrowing.</p>
<p>“I can’t because you already own me, David-sama! I’m yours! If I sign that contract you’ll be bound by clauses and terms.” She looked at him, her violet eyes wide and shining with the adoration she’d once faked and now felt with all her soul. “I want to be your shadow. I want to exist only to serve my <em>Goshujin-sama</em>. Please. Let me stay at your side. Not with a contract, but just as your Kurumi.”</p>
<p>Her master grinned. It was posessive.</p>
<p>“You’re perfect,” he whispered, pulling her close.</p>
<p>Kurumi let her eyes close, the violet contacts blurring as she drifted into the deep, dark safety of his embrace. There was no more Grace. There was only Kurumi, the heat of her master, and the overwhelming peace of finally belonging to a man who would never let her go.</p>
