        <div class="story-content">
            
<p>Kurumi was finishing her makeup when she heard the tone in her earpiece that meant David-sama was about to speak. Kurumi-san rarely answered him anymore, simply routing his calls directly to her ear. After all, they were both Kurumi. They were one voice.</p>
<p>“Is the proxy ready?” he asked.</p>
<p>Grace put her mascara down. “David-sama!” she squealed. The proxy. That’s what he called Grace. The body that Kurumi inhabited.</p>
<p>“Almost,” Kurumi said, staring at herself in the mirror. “I’ve dressed her just how you like. She’s going to be so cute today!” Kurumi was wearing an oversized, chunky knit sweater in a soft pastel pink. The sleeves were too long, covering her hands until only her fingertips peeked out, making her look small, delicate. Underneath, she wore denim shorts cut so high that the denim had completely vanished beneath her long sweater.</p>
<p>To anyone walking by, she would look like just a girl in a sweater. And nothing else.</p>
<p>Sometimes Kurumi wondered if he knew that he was mostly talking to Kurumi-chan now, instead of Kurumi-san. He never let on, never broke the illusion that they were one person, so she didn’t either. It didn’t matter. Increasingly, it wasn’t an illusion anyway. She was Kurumi, and Kurumi-san was increasingly just a voice in her head, helping her be perfect for David-sama.</p>
<p><em>“Ganbatte,”</em> he said, and cut the connection.</p>
<p><em>“It means…”</em> Kurumi-san started.</p>
<p>“I know what it means,” Kurumi said. She’d watched enough anime lately.</p>
<p><em>“Of course you do,”</em> Kurumi-san laughed. <em>“You hardly need me anymore.”</em></p>
<p>Kurumi arrived at the New York Aquarium an hour later, stepping out of the limo into the crisp ocean breeze. It was a Tuesday afternoon, and the crowds were thin, mostly tourists and tired mothers pushing strollers.</p>
<p>Kurumi checked her reflection in her phone. She looked adorable and helpless, with wide eyes that gave the impression she was lost or confused. She looked like Kurumi. </p>
<p>A group of college guys walked past. Their eyes went straight to her bare legs, scanning up to the hem of the sweater, trying to see if she was wearing anything underneath. A month ago, Grace would have pulled the sweater down. She would have felt embarrassed. Kurumi just blushed and looked down, enjoying their gaze. </p>
<p>A silver car of some variety pulled up. Kurumi didn’t know cars very well, but she could tell it was foreign and expensive. David-sama stepped out and handed the keys to the valet. The Aquarium didn’t have valet parking normally, but clearly they were making an exception. He was wearing a casual grey cashmere sweater and dark jeans. Even in casual wear, he looked sharper than every other man in the vicinity.</p>
<p>“David-sama!” Kurumi called out.</p>
<p>Kurumi walked over to him as fast as she could just the way she’d been practicing, with a bounce in her step and excitement in her face. David watched her approach, his eyes critical but pleased.</p>
<p>“The outfit,” he noted, glancing down at her bare legs. “Bold. I like it.”</p>
<p>Kurumi beamed at the compliment. “I chose it myself!” </p>
<p>He placed his hand on hers, his firm grip feeling reassuring. It was insane, she thought, that there had been a time when she hadn’t craved his touch. She had accepted another Terms of Service update today. He could touch her anywhere he liked now.</p>
<p>They walked into the aquarium, bypassing the line. David-sama had, of course, arranged for VIP passes.</p>
<p>The interior was cool and dim, with soft blue lighting that gave the aquarium a magical aura. David guided her, his hand around her waist, the entire time. David explained various fish, how they lived, and what they ate. He seemed especially animated when he talked about the sharks. She sensed he felt a kinship with them. Kurumi nodded, her eyes wide, not because she cared about sharks, but because she loved the sound of his voice explaining the world. She didn’t really care if any of what he was saying was true or not.</p>
<p>They stopped in front of the jellyfish exhibit. It was a massive cylindrical tank lit with ultraviolet light. Inside, hundreds of moon jellies swam rhythmically. They were translucent, fragile, and beautiful.</p>
<p><em>“Look at them, Kurumi-chan,”</em> Kurumi-san whispered in her ear. <em>“They’re so pretty. It must be wonderful to be one of these jellyfish. They don’t have a care in the world. They don’t even have brains! They’re taken care of here, and their only job is to look pretty.”</em></p>
<p>Kurumi watched them float. “It sounds nice.” </p>
<p>“What does?” David asked, stepping up behind her.</p>
<p>He placed his hands on her hips, his thumbs pressing into the soft knit of her sweater. She leaned back into him, letting him take her weight.</p>
<p>“To just be… pretty. And safe.”</p>
<p>David leaned down, his breath hot against her ear.</p>
<p>“And you’re always safe with me,” he said. She knew that, of course, but she loved hearing him say it anyway.</p>
<p>“I want to be your jellyfish, David-sama!” she said. “Soft. Fragile. Yours.”</p>
<p>He squeezed her hips. “You’re getting there.”</p>
<p>The moment was shattered by a high-pitched shriek. A screaming toddler was stomping his feet a few yards away. His mother, a woman who looked about Kurumi’s age, was trying to wrangle him. She looked exhausted. </p>
<p>“Kevin, please,” the woman begged. “Stop it.”</p>
<p>The noise was grating. Was this what Grace had wanted? To be a normal person? To settle down one day and have kids and struggle? She wondered if David would want kids with Kurumi. Even if he did, they’d have a nanny or something, right?</p>
<p><em>“That kid is ruining the moment,”</em> Kurumi-chan pouted.</p>
<p>Kurumi agreed. She turned and buried her face in David’s chest. “It’s so annoying,” she whined. “Make it stop.”</p>
<p>David held her tight for a moment, then guided her away. “I have something to show you anyway,” he said. With his hand on her back, David steered her toward a heavy steel door marked <em>Restricted Access: Authorized Personnel Only</em>. He swiped a keycard and the light turned green.</p>
<p>“Where are we going?” Kurumi asked, blinking up at him.</p>
<p>“Backstage,” David answered. “I arranged a private tour of the new research wing. I paid for it, after all.”</p>
<p>Inside, a woman in her thirties was waiting for them, her dark hair pulled back into a wet ponytail. She wore a black neoprene wetsuit, unzipped to the waist to reveal a functional sports bra.</p>
<p>“Mr. Spencer,” she said, extending a hand. Her grip was firm, her nails short and practical. “I’m Dr. Vance, one of the ichthyologists here. Thanks for the donation. It’s… certainly going to help with the new tiger shark program.”</p>
<p>Her eyes settled on Kurumi. It was a look Kurumi knew well—Grace had given that look to women plenty of times. It was a look of intellectual appraisal, followed by immediate dismissal. Grace would have been embarrassed to be dismissed so quickly, but Kurumi just felt pity for the woman. This was a woman who had to write grant proposals and manage budgets and whatever else they had to do to keep an aquarium running. She had worry and stress in her life.</p>
<p>The scientist led them through the back of the aquarium, showing them a juvenile tiger shark, a seal that was injured, and let them pet a dolphin. Kurumi loved it. She let David do most of the talking. </p>
<p>“Do you have any questions?” the doctor asked, as the tour was nearing its end.</p>
<p>David looked at Kurumi. This wasn’t one of his big galas where she was supposed to be quiet. She sensed he wanted her to chip in a bit more to the conversation, to be appreciative for arranging all this.</p>
<p>Kurumi twirled her hair with her free hand, trying to come up with a good question. “Why do you dye the water blue?” she asked after a moment. “It’s so pretty, but isn’t it bad for the animals?”</p>
<p>The woman sighed. “Kurumi, was it? We don’t dye the water. That’s just the lighting. Clear water refracts red light, making it appear blue.”</p>
<p>Oh, right. Grace had known that. Kurumi shrugged. “Oh, well, it’s very pretty anyway.”</p>
<p>David chuckled. “I don’t date her for her brains,” he explained.</p>
<p>Kurumi felt a flush of heat spread through her chest. To be so openly dismissed, to be reduced to an ornament in front of a serious scientist… it felt good. The scientist didn’t know what to say to that. She just gave Kurumi another pitying look. Grace hated being pitied. Kurumi didn’t care—she knew her place.</p>
<p>“Now, if you don’t mind, we’d like to have a moment back here to watch the sharks in private,” David said. “I know the way out.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, that’s not allowed.”</p>
<p>David just stared at her. “I apologize, I phrased that as a request to be polite. But to be clear, I wasn’t asking.”</p>
<p>The doctor hesitated, then nodded. “Of course. Enjoy the view.” She turned and walked away, her wet boots squeaking on the metal grating. </p>
<p>They were alone. The only sound was the hum of the pumps and the slosh of water in the tanks.</p>
<p>David turned to her. “Do we dye the water?” he repeated, mocking her.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, David-sama,” Kurumi whispered, looking down at her boots. “I’m not as smart as she is.”</p>
<p>He grabbed her by the waist and hoisted her up onto a waist-high concrete ledge overlooking one of the tanks. “You don’t need to be,” he said. Her legs dangled freely. The pink sweater rode up, exposing her thighs to the cool air of the facility.</p>
<p>David stepped between her legs. Their faces were inches apart. Kurumi looked down, bashful. His eyes were so intense, and she was too demure to meet his gaze. </p>
<p>David ran a hand through her hair. “You know what I want. You understand your purpose.” He leaned in and kissed her, his mouth finding hers with a sudden, forceful intensity. Kurumi wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling him closer.</p>
<p>They made out for a while. It wasn’t like the limo, the hungry urgent need they’d both felt there. David took it slow, just kissing her. Often on the lips, his tongue gently entering her mouth, but also on her neck and ear. His hands roamed her body, sliding under her sweater to trace lines along her side, stomach, and back. He avoided her breasts. Kurumi knew he wanted it, and she wanted it even more, but he was showing his control.</p>
<p>She wrapped her legs around him, holding him close, encouraging him, hoping he’d unclasp her bra or slide his hands into her pants. She felt herself getting slick, ready for him. Would he fuck her here? Would he bend her over the shark tank and take her like the predator he was? She moaned encouragement.</p>
<p>David broke the kiss, but stayed close, their foreheads touching. “It’s still not quite time,” he whispered into her lips. </p>
<p>“I want it so bad, David-sama,” she said with just a bit of a whine in her voice, just enough that she knew he would like it. “But I am yours. I’ll keep trying until I earn it.”</p>
<p>He took a step back, out of her embrace. “You will soon,” he said. “But for now, I do need release.”</p>
<p>It took a moment to register what he was asking for. <em>“Don’t just sit there,”</em> Kurumi-san said in her ear. “<em>Show him what a good girl you are!“</em></p>
<p>Kurumi slid off the ledge and immediately sank to her knees. It felt so right, looking up at him. She hastily unzipped his pants, letting his erection spring free. It was even more beautiful than when she’d seen it on the phone.</p>
<p>“Oh, David-sama,” she breathed.</p>
<p><em>“You’re so lucky,”</em> Kurumi-chan cooed in her ear. <em>“Isn’t it a privilege? Think of all the women who want him. But he’s sharing this with you!“</em></p>
<p>It <em>was</em> a privilege. Kurumi felt a surge of gratitude as she took him into her mouth. He was so big he filled her completely. Her mouth, her throat, her mind. She bobbed her head, finding a rhythm. She used her tongue, swirling it around the head just the way Kurumi-san had told her to. They’d been practicing at home with a dildo, hoping for the chance. </p>
<p>Kurumi lost herself in servicing him. She loved the taste of him, the way his hips bucked slightly, and the way his grip tightened in her hair, guiding her, controlling her.</p>
<p>“Deep,” David commanded.</p>
<p>Kurumi relaxed her throat. She forced herself to take more of him. She’d been practicing suppressing her gag reflex, practicing nasal breathing. He was too big to get it all the way in, but she did her best.</p>
<p>“Yes, Kurumi,” he groaned. “Just like that. Take it.” The praise felt so good. Her pussy was on fire, aching for him, wanting him desperately, but she knew it wasn’t going to happen here. His pleasure was all that mattered, and that made it all the hotter.</p>
<p>“I’m close,” David warned. She felt his cock getting harder, like an iron rod, in her mouth.</p>
<p><em>“Don’t stop!“</em> Kurumi-chan cheered. <em>“He’s going to give it to us! Open your throat, Kurumi-chan! Catch every drop!“</em></p>
<p>Kurumi squeezed her eyes shut and sucked harder, moaning around his cock. David arched his back, his hips snapping forward.</p>
<p>He erupted. “Kurumi!“</p>
<p>Kurumi didn’t pull away. She clamped her lips tight, swallowing him down, wave after wave. It was warm and thick, coating her throat. She swallowed it all, desperate not to spill a single drop. She was so turned on, so hot. She almost came from the pure submission of it. Almost. </p>
<p>David held her head there for a long moment as he came down, his breathing ragged. Finally, he stepped back, pulling out of her mouth with a wet pop. Kurumi slumped back on her heels, wiping a stray string of saliva from her chin. She imagined what she looked like to him with her wide eyes and flushed face. She hoped she looked like a mess. She hoped she looked used.</p>
<p>David looked down at her, zipping up his pants. The look in his eyes wasn’t critical anymore—it was satisfied, possessive. He reached down and brushed a strand of purple hair out of her face. “Good girl,” he whispered. </p>
<p>Kurumi shivered. “Thank you, David-sama. Thank you for letting me.” She meant every word of it, it was such a privilege.</p>
<p>“You earned it,” he said, adjusting his sweater. “Now stand up. We have a dinner reservation.”</p>
<p>Kurumi scrambled to her feet, her knees slightly wobbly.</p>
<p><em>“Did you hear that?”</em> Kurumi-san whispered, her voice soft and dreamy in Kurumi’s ear. <em>“He said you earned it. We’re doing so well, Kurumi-chan. He’s going to keep us forever!“</em></p>
<p>Kurumi smoothed down her sweater, still feeling the sensation of his cock in her mouth.</p>
<p>Forever. That sounded nice.</p>
