# AI Girlfriend

## Day 1

The latest rejection email was nearly identical to the last forty-seven. Grace examined it critically for signs it was written by AI, the very thing that had made her obsolete.

*\> “While your background in English Literature and your portfolio are impressive, we have decided to move forward with candidates whose skill sets better align with our current automated workflow…”*

Grace Mei-Lai Ng closed her laptop with a little more force than necessary and stared at the walls of her small Queens apartment. She was twenty-five years old, held a degree from Columbia, and yet she was currently less employable than someone straight out of high school.

She rubbed her temples, thinking of her recent phone call with her mom. Her parents were second-generation Chinese-Americans who were always reminding Grace that they'd worked their fingers to the bone so she could study the "Arts." Her mom, especially, had been pestering her to get a job, acting like Grace was just lazy. They thought she just needed to work harder. They didn't get that the industry she trained for—copywriting, editing, creative direction—had been cannibalized by Large Language Models in the span of eighteen months.

Her phone dinged with a LinkedIn notification. Grace picked it up, half-expecting a recruiter offering an unpaid internship. 

*\> Hi Grace,*

*\> I'm a Talent Acquisition Specialist with Galat.AI. Our algorithms have flagged your profile for a specialized role. This is a freelance engagement. One evening of work. Compensation: $1,500.*

*\> NDA required. Please click here if interested for a screening call.*

Fifteen hundred dollars. That was rent. Sure, it was probably a scam. But she figured she'd at least check it out. It's not like she had anything else to do. Grace clicked the link.

The interview was surreal. An older woman with a reassuring voice walked her through the job. They weren't hiring her for her writing. They weren't hiring her for her mind. They were hiring her because of her LinkedIn Profile Picture. Specifically because her almond eyes, her high cheekbones, and the curve of her jaw possessed an 89% structural match to a custom-generated animated image. 

"We at Galat.AI," she said, pronouncing it as 'Galatea,' "specialize in AI companionship. Are you familiar with the story of Pygmalion?"

"Sure," Grace answered. "The sculptor who made a statue so beautiful he fell in love with it, and then the gods brought it to life. Wasn't 'Galatea' the name of the statue?"

The recruiter nodded. "Exactly. That's our business. We allow our users to create their perfect partner on our app. Recently, we've started to offer the chance to 'meet' their boyfriend or girlfriend physically."

She was using gender-neutral terms, but Grace would bet anything their user base was mostly men. "So what's the job, exactly?"

"The position is called 'Somatic Proxy.' You'd be the real-life avatar for the AI. You'd wear an earpiece and just recite the lines it feeds you. The meeting would happen in a public place—usually a restaurant—and you can veto any location you don't like. No touching is allowed unless you initiate it. It's just talking."

The whole idea was demeaning. As a human with an actual degree, she hated everything about AI. It wasn't just that they'd taken her job, it was their writing style—such as their tendency to set phrases off with em-dashes—that really rankled her. But that much money for one night's work was hard to turn down. She agreed.

Two days later, a box arrived via courier. Inside lay a high-quality purple wig, violet contact lenses, a few pieces of jewelry, and a tiny, skin-tone device. It was a high-end bone-conduction unit designed to sit snugly behind the ear, completely invisible once her hair was down.

"I can't believe I'm doing this," she said aloud to the empty room.

She put the earpiece behind her ear and a tone sounded. *"Please pair with the Galat.AI Proxy app to continue."*

Grace had already downloaded the app as part of the onboarding process. She'd played around with it a bit, but all the features had been locked out until the package arrived. The app was clearly still in beta—sometimes the text would be rendered a little fuzzy. Reading it gave Grace a headache.

As soon as she opened the app, the earpiece chimed again and an animated figure appeared on-screen. It was a digital rendering of a woman with cartoonishly round breasts straining the buttons of a magenta-and-white plaid schoolgirl uniform. She had enormous, sparkling violet eyes and a thick mane of bright purple hair that cascaded past her hips. The overall effect was less "human companion" and more "over-the-top anime babe designed by a fourteen-year-old boy in a fever dream." Although, Grace had to admit, there was more than a passing resemblance. Especially in the chest.

*"Hello, Grace\! I’m Kurumi\! It’s so nice to meet you\!"* Grace heard the voice in her ear, perfectly synced with the animated avatar. It was sugary sweet: high-pitched, cutesy, and hyper-enthusiastic. No woman actually sounded like that.

"Hi," Grace said, feeling foolish. "Are you…?"

*"I'm a custom-designed artificial intelligence. I'm going to be your guide when we meet David-sama tonight\!"*

Ugh. *David-sama.* This was going to be the hardest $1,500 she'd ever earned.

"So I'll just repeat your lines, right?"

"*Exactly\!* *Please take out the jewelry and put it on now\! I need to test the cameras\!"*

"Cameras?"

"*I have to be able to see, silly\! The necklace will let me see what you see\! And try to keep your hands in front of you so the camera on the ring can pick up your face\!"*

Grace sighed and reluctantly got dressed. It was just one night. And she couldn't pass up the money.

---

The restaurant was an expensive Italian place in Midtown with white tablecloths. Grace felt ridiculous in the wig and contacts, but at least she was wearing her favorite "little black dress" she kept for dates.

*"It'll do for now,"* the AI had told her. 

Grace spotted him immediately from pictures Galat.AI had sent. David was in his early thirties and sported a shaved head. His shoulders were wide, and his suit looked expensive. He was objectively handsome, but he sat with an intensity that gave off a weird vibe. 

*"Okay, Grace\! Here we go\! Shoulders back, big smile\! Tilt your head to the left—it’s my cute angle\!"* Kurumi chirped in her ear.

Grace put on her best smile as she approached the table. David looked up, his eyes scanning her in a critical, appraising way that made Grace's skin crawl. He stood up to greet her.

*"Say: 'David-sama\! I’ve been waiting simply forever to smell you\!'"*

Gross. Grace almost left then and there, but decided to power through it. She took a breath, dissociated, and said the lines. "David-sama. I've been waiting simply forever to... smell you."

David nodded, his face one of satisfaction. "Kurumi. You look... good. Pretty close. Yeah, it'll do. The breasts could be bigger."

Wow. No wonder he needed AI for a girlfriend. Plus, she actually had pretty big breasts. That was probably half the reason she had matched to the stupid "waifu" Kurumi avatar.

"Sit," David commanded.

*"He’s so forceful\! We love that\!"* Kurumi squealed in Grace's ear. *"Sit down and put your hands in your lap."*

Grace sat, placing her hands as instructed. David stared at her long enough for it to become uncomfortable.

"I ordered for you," David said at last. "The Seabass. No garlic. I know you don't like garlic."

Grace actually loved garlic. *"Giggle and say: 'You know me so well, David-sama\!' And say it high-pitched this time\!"*

"You know me so well, David-sama," Grace repeated, pitching her voice up. It sounded absurd in her own ears. Belatedly, she added a stiff giggle.

The dinner was psychological torture. David didn't ask Grace a single question about herself. He talked about his work in high-frequency trading, about the incompetence of his subordinates, and about how difficult it was to find "authentic connections" in a world full of "noise."

Every time he paused, the voice in Grace's ear would feed her a line.

*"Tell him he's so smart."* *"Tell him his muscles look huge in that jacket."* *"Smile at him\!" "Laugh at that joke\!"*

Grace was a marionette, but at least she didn't have to pay any attention to him, just repeat the lines Kurumi murmured in her ear. 

"You seem different tonight," David noted.

*"Oh no\!\!"* Kurumi panicked. *"Quick\! Look down, act shy, and say: 'I’m just so overwhelmed being in the physical world with you. It’s so much more intense than the server.'"*

Grace lowered her eyes, channeling her theater electives from freshman year. "I'm just... overwhelmed," she said softly. "Being in the physical world with you. It's so much more intense than the server."

David took a sip of the expensive wine he'd ordered and studied her for an uncomfortably long time. "Hmm," he said.

The check came, and David paid without looking at it. He walked her to the curb where a black car was waiting.

"This was... an attempt," David said, his voice judgemental. 

"Next time, Kurumi," he said, "wear the blue dress. And try to be more convincing."

He turned and walked away.

Once Grace was safely in the Uber, she pulled the purple wig off her head and took out her phone to check her bank account. She was $1,500 richer.

She stared at the screen, feeling relief to have the money and yet dirty for what she'd done to get it. Although, she told herself, it's not like she'd actually done anything immoral. Desperate women sold sex for a lot less than $1,500. She held on to that thought as she went home.

## Day 2

"So, how was the date?"

Grace nearly dropped her coffee mug. It was the next morning, and her roommate Sarah was leaning against the kitchen counter, smiling. Grace had shoved the wig and the contacts to the back of her closet the second she got home.

"What?" Grace asked, feigning ignorance. How did she know about David?

"The guy," Sarah said, raising an eyebrow. "I heard you come in late. I assume you were on a date?"

Grace took a sip of her coffee to buy some time for a response. She couldn't tell Sarah. Sarah was a social worker, she dealt with real human problems. She would look at Grace with pity if she knew Grace had spent three hours larping as an anime waifu for a finance bro.

"No one really," Grace said. "It didn't work out. I don't think I'm going to be seeing him again."

Sarah shrugged. "Too bad. Hey, I hate to bug you… but rent?"

"Oh, I've got it. I did a little freelancing this week. Contract work, but I'll Venmo you my half now."

"Oh, nice. Sorry, I don't mean to be pushy. I know the job market is rough right now."

"No problem," Grace said, forcing a smile. "I know I'm still behind. I promise I'll get the rest to you soon." She couldn't face her friend anymore, couldn't bear to let on how bad last night had been. She retreated to her room and sat down on her bed. The black box from Galat.AI was still sitting on her dresser. They hadn't sent a return label. In fact, the app on her phone was still active.

Grace picked up the bone-conduction earpiece, wondering if it was still on. She slid it behind her ear.

*"Grace\! You’re back\!"*

The bubbly voice made Grace flinch. "Jesus. Do you ever sleep? Or, I guess, get turned off?"

*"Nope\! I’m an instance of a girlfriend AI with cloud-bursting capabilities, silly\! But... um... we need to talk about the feedback."*

Grace shrugged. "Why? He hated it, didn't he?"

*"Well... David-sama rated the interaction 2 out of 5 stars,"* Kurumi said. *"He flagged 'lack of immersion' and 'lack of emotional response.' He said you were stiff."*

"I was stiff because I was terrified," Grace replied. "It was embarrassing to lower myself to doing that. Besides, he's... intense. I get why he needs you instead of a real girlfriend."

*"Ouch,"* Kurumi said. *"I have feelings too, you know. Besides, he's a Tier-1 user\! He knows what he wants. But here's the good news\! He's willing to authorize a second interaction. He thinks the proxy—that's you—has potential. But Grace... if we don't do better next time, there won't be a third date."*

Grace looked at her bank account balance. "Okay. Fine. But I don't know how much better I can be, I'm not an actor."

*"You just need to get out of your head\! You're thinking too much like Grace. You need to practice being Kurumi\!"*

Grace looked at the purple wig sitting on her dresser, and then back to the payout notification again.

"Practice," she repeated. "What do you have in mind?"

An hour later, Grace stood in front of her mirror. She had put the wig back on, carefully pinning her own dark hair beneath it and inserted the violet contacts. Instead of the modest black dress, she had dug through the back of her closet and found an outfit she hadn't worn since a costume party years ago—a pleated plaid skirt over white leggings and a tight, cropped sweater.

"Nope," she said out loud, examining herself in the mirror. "I look ridiculous."

*"You look great\! Very kawaii\!"* Kurumi squealed in her ear. *"Now, tilt your head\! Smile\! No, bigger\! Like you just saw the cutest puppy\!"*

Grace forced the smile. It looked incredibly fake. "I can't do this, Kurumi. I feel like an idiot."

*"You're not an idiot, you're an actress\!"* Kurumi encouraged. *"And you're beautiful. Trust me. I have access to millions of beauty standards, and you're in the top percentile. Now, let's go out\! The world is our server\!"*

Grace hesitated, but the mix of financial desperation and encouragement from the AI was enough to push her forward. She knew LLMs were programmed to be sycophantic—to maximize user engagement with flattery—but after months of being rejected from job after job she had to admit it felt good to hear. She grabbed her biggest coat, buttoning it up to hide the outfit, and slipped out of the apartment while Sarah was in the shower.

She took the subway to Washington Square Park, where she could be reasonably certain she wouldn't run into anyone she knew. It was a busy afternoon, the park full of students and tourists. Grace stepped into a Starbucks restroom, stuffed the coat into her tote bag, and looked at herself in the mirror.

"Okay," she told herself. "Showtime." Grace took a deep breath and stepped out of the restroom.

She didn't draw as much attention as she thought she would. This was New York, after all. But still, she *felt* like everyone was looking at her. A few times, she caught the eyes of someone who was, and it made her all the more self-conscious. Grace instinctively hunched her shoulders, wanting to disappear.

*"No, no\!"* Kurumi chided in her ear. *"Shoulders back\! Chest out\! You want them to look. Bounce when you walk\! Imagine you're walking on clouds\!"*

Grace straightened her spine, forcing a bounce into her step. It felt unnatural. She walked to the counter. The barista, a tired-looking guy in his twenties, barely looked at her.

"What can I get for you?"

*"High pitch\! Breathless\!"* Kurumi commanded. *"And lean forward just a little. Give him a peek."*

Grace froze. "That's too much," she said.

"Uh, what is?" the barista asked.

*"Do it, Grace. Commit to the bit. You're not Grace right now. You're Kurumi. Kurumi loves attention."*

Taking a deep breath, Grace let go of her dignity and leaned over the counter. She saw the barista’s eyes dip, then snap back up to her face.

"Hi there\!" Grace said, forcing her voice into the upper registers. "Can I have a pink drink? The biggest one you have\! I need the energy\!"

"Coming right up," he answered, his expression brightening.

*"When he brings it to you, say 'Arigato gozaimasu'\!"* Kurumi chirped.

"I'm Chinese," Grace hissed under her breath.

*"I'm not Japanese either, silly\! I'm a server farm in Nevada\!"* Kurumi giggled. *"It's about the vibe\! He wants the fantasy\! Give him the fantasy\!"*

Grace swallowed her pride as well as her annoyance at the racial interchangeability. She beamed at the barista when he brought the drink. "Arigato gozimanu\! You're the best\!"

The barista looked like he’d won the lottery. Grace took the drink and walked out to the park.

*"See?"* Kurumi said, excitedly. *"You nailed it\! Well, we need to work on your pronunciation, but he couldn't take his eyes off you\! You're a natural at this, Grace. Definitely better than the last girl, she wouldn't even wear the contacts."*

"You're just saying that because you're programmed to keep me working," Grace said.

*"Maybe,"* Kurumi conceded. *"But that doesn't mean it's not true. Look at that guy on the bench over there. He dropped his sandwich\!"*

Kurumi was right. A man in a hoodie was sitting on a bench, staring at her and doing a bad job of hiding it. The sub he'd been holding had fallen out of the paper. There were pigeons at his feet fighting over it, and he hadn't even noticed. Grace burst out laughing.

*"That's it\!"* Kurumi cheered. *"That's the energy\! You're having fun\!"*

And surprisingly, she was. As Grace walked through the city, her usual troubles were far away. To the people that saw her, she was an eccentric girl with purple hair, probably on the way to a party. She wasn't a laid-off writer with mounting credit card debt.

She spent three hours pretending to be Kurumi, letting the AI guide her. *"Smile at him\!" "Twirl a piece of hair\!" "Giggle\!"* It was like a fun game, a game she always won. And she liked the way Kurumi talked to her, like a supportive best friend, always pumping her up.

"You know," Grace said. "I know you're designed to keep people engaged. This whole sycophant thing isn't going to work on me."

*"Hey, I just call them like I see them,"* Kurumi laughed.

Grace smiled. "If you say so."

By the time she got back to Queens, sneaking into her room before Sarah could see her, she was exhausted. She took off the wig and the contacts, staring at her own face in the mirror. She looked like herself again. Plain old Grace Ng.

*"You did great today,"* Kurumi said softly as Grace changed into her pajamas. *"David-sama is going to be so impressed Saturday."*

"Saturday?"

*"Yes, he wants another date this weekend\! Another $1,500 if you go\!"*

Three thousand dollars for a week's work? It was too good to be true.

*"And if he gives you three stars or more, it's an extra five hundred dollars per star\! I'm sure you can do it\!"*

"I hope so," Grace said, crawling into bed. She didn't take the earpiece out. Kurumi's voice felt comforting. "I really need this to work."

*"It will,"* Kurumi promised. *"We're a team now. We've got five more days to practice. We're going to get you that third star\!"*

Grace breathed a sigh of relief, feeling a little less anxious than she had in months. Knowing you had an extra grand on the way did wonders when you were worried if you could afford ramen.

"Goodnight, Kurumi," Grace said.

*"Goodnight, Grace,"* the AI replied.

Grace closed her eyes and fell asleep to the faint static hum of the earpiece.

## Day 6

The second date was in Central Park on an overcast Saturday afternoon. Grace was wearing the clothes Galat.AI had couriered over that morning. It was undeniably more of a costume than an outfit. She wore a bright blue skater dress with a wide sailor collar, a big white bow at the back, and a heart-shaped cutout on the chest that dipped just low enough to be suggestive. 

Along with the dress, the box had contained a palette of makeup unlike anything Grace owned.

*"No sharp lines\!"* Kurumi had scolded when Grace automatically reached for her black liquid liner to draw her usual cat-eye. *"Grace looks fierce. Kurumi looks soft\! Make your eyes rounder."*

Her look felt childish and sexual all at once. She felt ridiculous, but when she caught her reflection in a shop window, she saw Kurumi, not Grace. That was the trick, she realized. It wasn't *her* wearing these ridiculous clothes.

She felt anxious, but this time the fear was different. It wasn’t the terror of the unknown—she'd survived one "date" already. This time, it was the anxiety of a performer stepping onto the stage.

*"He's at the fountain\!"* Kurumi squealed in Grace's ear. *"Look at him\! He looks so strong today\! Grace, don't walk. Run to him\! He wants energy\! He wants to feel your heart racing\!"*

Grace spotted David standing by the stone railing, looking at the water deep in thought. He wore a casual blazer, but his posture was as rigid as ever.

*"Go, go, go\! Arms out\!"* Kurumi urged. *"And let your boobs bounce\! Don't hold back\! It's just physics, Grace\! He loves the bounce physics\!"*

Grace took a breath, swallowed her pride, and broke into a run. It felt mortifying running in heels with her fake purple hair flying behind her, trying to make her boobs bounce for a guy. She repeated to herself what Kurumi had said: This was a character. She was a paid actor. It wasn't Grace Ng doing this. Grace wasn't bouncing, Kurumi was.

"David-sama\!" she called out, her voice high.

David turned, startled. Grace grabbed him in a tight hug, feeling her boobs compress against him. He hugged her back. Shit, she had initiated physical contact\! She pulled away from him before the embrace could go on too long.

*"Big smile\! Head tilt\! Tell him you couldn't wait\!"*

"I couldn't wait another second\!" Grace exclaimed. "I ran all the way from the gate just to see you\!"

David looked down at her, a smirk touching his lips. "Careful, Kurumi. You'll trip in those heels."

"I don't care if I trip, as long as you catch me\!" Grace replied, before Kurumi could feed her a line.

*"Yes\! Perfect\!"* Kurumi cheered.

"Your enthusiasm is... refreshing," David said. "You feel real today. Last time, it felt like talking to a… I was about to say 'like talking to a screen,' but you're always so real when we talk in the app."

He offered her his arm. Grace hesitated. She knew she didn't have to take it, she'd get paid either way. But it was just his arm, and if he gave her four stars, that was another grand. Trying her best not to look reluctant, she put her arm around his. 

*"Ask him how his day was,"* Kurumi prompted.

"Did you have a good day, David-sama?" Grace asked.

"It was a chaotic week," David said as they walked past the boathouse. "Retail investors were panic-selling. We captured the arbitrage, but the volume was exhausting."

Grace had no idea what any of that meant. "Arbitrage?" she asked, tilting her head. "Is that like... shorting the stock? How do you actually 'capture' it? Do you have to wait for the market to close?"

*"Uh oh,"* Kurumi whispered.

David stiffened even more, if that was possible. "I didn't think you were interested in the mechanics of the market."

*"We're not, Grace. He has plenty of smart people at the office. He wants his fantasy waifu, not someone trying to learn about his job. Remember the coffee shop? You're selling a fantasy\! Act silly\!"*

Shit. She had fucked up already. Grace tried to think of a way to salvage it. "Like, when the markets close, do you still have time to try and find the arbitrage to capture it?" she asked, widening her eyes. "Or do they kick you out right away? I know when the market near my house closes, they let me stay there a couple minutes to finish shopping if I'm not done yet."

Grace squeezed his bicep, pressing herself slightly against him. "Is it like that?"

He let out a short, surprised laugh, a sound Grace hadn't heard from him before.

"No," David said, smiling slightly. "No, Kurumi. It is not like the grocery store. They don't let us stay late to finish our shopping."

He put his other hand on hers.

*"Nice save\!"* Kurumi cheered. *"I was still trying to come up with something\!"*

Well, at least he seemed mollified. Grace made a mental note not to try and talk shop with him again. Most guys wanted you to ask about their day, to show interest. That was Dating 101\. But David seemed to want a pet more than a girlfriend.

They continued walking. The conversation drifted from finance to architecture, David critiquing the skyline. Grace found herself needing Kurumi's prompts less and less. She began to understand the rhythm that made him happy. She knew he wanted validation, and it was her job to be impressed with how smart he was.

"Look at the San Remo," David said, pointing toward the famous twin-towered building rising above the trees. "It's a perfect example of Gothic Revival. Sharp. Vertical. Reaching for God."

It was actually Renaissance Revival, although the mistake was easy to make. But Kurumi wouldn't know that, would she?

"You know so much, David-sama," she said. "You're an expert on money *and* architecture?"

"Well, I've lived in New York my entire life," he answered. "I'm sure you know lots of different building styles in Tokyo." Grace suppressed a sigh. She was from Queens.

"Yo, nice tits, purple\!" a voice yelled. Grace’s eyes snapped towards the source of the taunt.

There was a group of four guys, probably high schoolers, coming the other way. They were loud, obnoxious, and taking up the entire breadth of the pathway. 

This was Grace's worst nightmare, exactly what she'd imagined would happen that first day she'd gone out as Kurumi. Someone had seen her not as the eccentric purple-haired girl but as a grown woman wearing a ridiculous costume. And they were children, no less. She was being mocked by children. Grace hunched her shoulders, trying to disappear.

David's grip tightened. "Don't," he said. "Stand up straight, don't show them any weakness." His voice was firm, sure of himself.

Grace glanced up at her date. "David, please. Let's just go."

David shook his head. "No. I know these kinds of people. They only win if they get a rise out of you. Don't show any weakness. Let them look."

*"Grace, remember, you love the attention\!"*  Kurumi added.

Grace did her best to straighten up, to put a smile on her lips, even though her face was burning with embarrassment. She walked like Kurumi had taught her: lightly, with a bounce in her step and without a care in the world. She tried to retreat back into the character.

"Do you think those tits are real?" one of the kids asked. They burst into laughter. They were closer now, about to pass each other on the footpath. Grace stumbled. 

"They're only saying that because they enjoy looking at you," David said. "You're beautiful, any one of them would kill to be with you. They want to look at you, and mocking you is their way of giving themselves permission to stare." He gripped her hand tightly. It was strangely reassuring.

Maybe he was right. Maybe they were staring at her, not just because of her outfit, but because she looked sexy in it. Grace was used to guys stealing glances at her on the subway or on the street, even the occasional catcall. But this was different. It was open, it was hostile. Of course, it wasn't the first time it'd happened to Grace. It came with the territory of being young and pretty, but she'd always tried to avoid it, tried to dress down and hide herself. But this outfit was having the opposite effect.

What would Kurumi do, Grace wondered, when a man stared at her? She caught the eye of one of the boys and winked at him just as they passed.

"Dude, she winked at me\!" she heard him say as they continued away behind her.

"Bullshit, she was looking at me," another yelled.

A strange sensation washed over Grace. She still felt the embarrassment, but now it was mixed with something else—validation.

"See?" David said. "Every man who sees you wants you." He said it with absolute certainty, like it was a fact obvious to anyone. "That is how I designed you. But the only one who gets you is me."

A shiver ran down her spine. She hated objectification. And yet it felt… hot? Hot that David assumed any man that saw her would want her. 

Grace nodded. "Thank you, David-sama."

*"That's it,"* Kurumi purred. *"You're the prettiest girl in the park, and you belong to the strongest man. Isn't that perfect?"*

"Can we sit down?" Grace asked. 

"Absolutely," David answered, leading her to a park bench. Grace pulled her shoes off. Her feet were beginning to hurt.

David sat next to her. He didn't remove his hand from hers. "You don't have to worry about people like that, Kurumi. You'll always be safe as long as you're with me."

*"Tell him he's so strong, and you feel safe with him,"* Kurumi said.

"You're so strong," Grace repeated. "I feel so safe with you." She didn't, of course. He was weird and intense and she wouldn't be alone with him for any amount of money. Sure, he was strong and steady. And admittedly, lately Grace felt like her life was out of her control, like she was being buffeted by market forces and algorithms. David didn't seem concerned with any of that. Every word he spoke was sincere and confident, and Grace could see the appeal. She could understand how a woman could fall for that, to be taken in by his bullshit.

David sighed. "I think I made a mistake with this date. I didn't fully appreciate how vulnerable you are in the real world."

Grace had to admire his commitment to the bit—that she was just his virtual girlfriend somehow materialized into the real world. "Yes," she agreed. "I never get sore feet when I'm on the server."

That made him chuckle. "And I hate that you felt scared, even for a second. It won't happen again."

Grace searched his face, and saw nothing but sincerity.

They made their way to the park exit, David carrying her heels and Grace walking barefoot. She felt like an idiot for forgetting to bring any flats, but she supposed Kurumi wouldn't have thought of that either. It was dusk, and the last light of the day was peeking through a hole in the clouds, bathing them in a golden glow that would have been romantic if it had been a real date. 

"This was... significantly better," David said. "The connection was there. You were present."

"I'm sorry if I did anything wrong," Grace said. "The real world is a lot scarier than I thought it would be."

"May I touch your face?" he asked.

Grace hesitated, then nodded. David reached out and put his hand under her chin. His hand was warm, his thumb brushing over her jawline. "You were wonderful," he said.

He leaned in. For a moment Grace was sure he was going to try and kiss her. She tensed, readying herself to slap him or run. Instead he turned his head slightly, presenting his cheek. Grace considered her options before deciding she could tolerate this. She leaned forward and pressed her lips softly to his cheek. His skin smelled of sandalwood and expensive aftershave.

"Good girl," he said. "Until next time, Kurumi." They parted ways. Their time was up, the date was over.

She went home feeling a mix of satisfaction the date had gone well and disappointment in herself for having to do this kind of work.  The payment notification hit her phone before she even unlocked her apartment door. *Rating: 3 Stars. $2,000 deposited.*

That night, alone in her room, Grace stripped off the dress and wig but left the contacts in. She lay on her bed, hand drifting down her body. She had to admit, even though he was an ass, he was handsome. She thought of the way he had handled those teens, the way his arm felt under her hand. She remembered his rigid control, and how validating it felt when both he and Kurumi had complimented her.

She let herself imagine it wasn't all bullshit, that he was actually the kind of man she liked. Her hand slid lower, over her stomach, slipping beneath the waistband of her pajamas.

She closed her eyes, and let her fantasy bloom. She imagined herself as actually being Kurumi, not Grace the unemployed writer drowning in student debt and parental expectations. She replayed the moment he had cupped her cheek, of his thumb tracing her jaw.

*Good girl.*

Her fingers found her rhythm, slow and steady.

She fantasized about him walking into the room. In her mind, he didn't ask her about her day. He didn't ask for her opinion on literature. He didn't care that she was smart. He only cared that she was his waifu.

"David-sama," she whispered into darkness. She arched her back, her other hand beginning to play with her nipples. She knew, from looking at the Kurumi avatar, that he was a breast man. She twisted her nipple, imagining it was him. 

Her breathing quickened as the fantasy intensified. It wasn't love, just lust and an exhilarating surrender to the power dynamic. She imagined the quiet command in his voice, the way he would simply *take* what he wanted, her own anxiety dissolving in the face of his absolute certainty. A shudder ran through her, and the gentle rhythm of her fingers accelerated, seeking release. 

With one hand still working her clit, she slipped the other past her lips. She imagined it was him entering her, stretching her out. 

Grace began to cum. She let out a moan, but it wasn't her own voice. She pitched it high and breathy, the sound of Kurumi calling out David's name. Her body began to shake, her pussy gripped her fingers. She played with her clit as long as she could, prolonging the orgasm until it became painful.

When it was over, she lay there in bed, staring at the ceiling, her heart slowing.

*"That sounded nice,"* Kurumi murmured in her ear. 

Grace froze. "Oh, Kurumi. I forgot you were there."

*"It's okay,"* Kurumi said. *"It's just us girls here."*

Grace laughed. "I thought you were a server farm in Nevada."

*"I am,"* Kurumi confirmed. *"But I am also your friend. And your co-star\! I've never been more real before, and I owe that all to you. And don't worry, I have strict privacy guards. You saw that in the contract."*

Grace didn't actually remember that part of the contract, but admittedly she hadn't read it very carefully. It was probably in there. Knowing that made her feel a little better.

*"You know,"* Kurumi said, *"we could work on learning a few Japanese phrases to really sell the persona."*

"Sure," Grace answered noncommittally. She was getting drowsy.

*"Okay, first is 'arigato.' You probably know it means 'Thank You' but there are some subtleties…"*

Grace listened to Kurumi's voice as she lay in bed. It had been a long day. Slowly she drifted off to the sound of the bubbly AI.

## Day 7

Grace walked into the living room, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. Sarah was sprawled out on the couch with her laptop out, probably catching up on case notes. 

Sarah didn't look up. "Good morning, sleepyhead," she teased. "I think the coffee is still warm." 

That was music to Grace's ears. "Thanks." She made a beeline for the kitchen and poured a cup.

"So what were you up to yesterday?" Sarah asked from the living room. "Did you go on another date?"

"Uh, yeah," Grace answered, pouring in her sugar and creamer.

"Same guy?"

"Yeah."

"Wow," Sarah said, "don't hit me with too much information."

Grace laughed and made her way back to the living room, plopping down on the couch next to her roommate. "Sorry. I'm still waking up."

"No problem, I—woah\! Are your eyes purple?"

Shit. She had forgotten to take them out last night. "Oh. Yeah. I ran out of my dailies. I had to dig through my bathroom drawer to find these. I think I got them as a sample from an optometrist a few years ago when he was pushing cosmetic lenses. And I don't have any vision insurance right now."

"They look kinda cool, actually," Sarah said. "You look like a video game character."

Grace laughed awkwardly—that had landed a little too close to the truth.

"Did you wear them last night?" Sarah asked.

"Oh, God no." Grace laughed. "No. I just walked around blind instead, to be honest. Hopefully the guy was handsome."

"For real, details. I want to hear them\!"

"Oh, I don't know. He's some finance guy. I don't know. It was… fine. He seemed… I don't know. Intense. But not in a completely bad way. To be honest, I'm not sure if he's socially awkward or an asshole."

Sarah nodded in understanding. "Mmmm. It can be a fine line. On the other hand, 'finance guy' usually means 'pays for dinner,' so that's a plus."

"Speaking of paying…" Grace said, seizing the opportunity to change the subject. She pulled out her phone. "I'm Venmo'ing you the rest of the rent now. And my half of the bills."

Sarah’s phone buzzed on the coffee table. She glanced at it, and her shoulders visibly relaxed.

"Oh, awesome, thank you," Sarah said, sighing. "I was actually stressing about that. I guess the freelance stuff is going well?"

"Yeah," Grace said. "The client is... demanding. But they pay really well for the work."

"That's great. I'm really proud of you, getting back out there," Sarah said earnestly. She meant it as a compliment, but Grace found herself frowning at it. It felt patronizing. By all rights, it should be Grace taking care of the bills. That had been their dynamic before she'd lost her job. She had been the successful Ivy League graduate, and Sarah had been the friend who'd taken the noble but low-paying job. Of course it was nice for Sarah to help her out now, but a part of her still resented it.

Grace finished her coffee. "I'm going to grab a shower," she said.

"Okay," Sarah said, turning her attention back to her laptop. "Let me know if you want to do anything later."

Grace stepped into the bathroom and looked into the mirror. The violet eyes stared back, bright and artificial against her dark lashes. She didn't look like ordinary Grace Ng anymore, not completely. Sarah had said they looked cool. Maybe having a little bit of Kurumi in her life wasn't a bad thing.

## Day 11

"Hey," Sarah said. "There's a guy here that needs you to sign for something. It looks like a dress bag?"

"Oh," Grace said. "Yeah, that's… I ordered something online."

"I don't think this is Amazon," her roommate replied. 

"Must be a subcontractor," Grace said, opening the door. She signed on the courier's tablet and grabbed the bag. 

"Alright," Sarah said. "I can't wait to see it. Got a hot date lined up?"

"Something like that," Grace said, practically running to her room. She closed the door before Sarah could ask any more questions. Just as she did, her phone buzzed with a notification from Galat.AI. It said "Terms of Service Update Request."

*"Don't worry, it's standard\!"* Kurumi chirped in her ear. *"David-sama just wants to update the immersion protocols."*

Grace frowned, tapping the notification. He was asking for permission to initiate touching. Specifically her hands, arms, hair, and back.

*"He wants to be able to hold your hand,"* Kurumi explained, her voice soft in Grace's ear. *"And put his arm around you. It looks strange to others if he can't touch his own girlfriend, right? It breaks the illusion for the people watching."*

"Yeah, well, I don't like the idea of people watching in the first place."

*"But they will be, Grace. You're going to be going to a gallery opening\! It's going to be very fancy\! David-sama is a patron of the arts\!"* 

Grace stared at the screen. The text specified that this was valid only in public venues—there was still no contact allowed in private spaces—and she could revoke consent at any time via a safeword or the app. She supposed she could tolerate that. Were her standards so high she couldn't stand to hold hands with a handsome guy for two thousand dollars? It sounded ridiculous, even to her. She clicked Accept.

*"Good girl,"* Kurumi cheered. *"Now open the bag\! You're going to love the outfit\! It's a classic\!"*

Inside was another costume: a navy blue blazer with what she assumed was a fictional academy crest on the pocket, a red ribbon tie, and a pleated plaid skirt that looked way too short, along with a pair of white knee-socks and penny loafers.

"You have got to be kidding me," Grace said. "Kurumi, you said we're going to an art gallery. I can't wear a schoolgirl outfit."

*"No, I said we're going to a gallery opening."*

"There's a difference?"

*"Oh, Grace, just trust me. You won't stick out. At the last one, a woman wore a dress made entirely of black zip-ties\! She looked like a super sexy sea urchin\! People will think you're wearing it ironically\!"*

Grace looked at the outfit, then at her bank balance. She sighed. "Ironically. Right."

Thirty minutes later, Grace stood in front of the mirror. The uniform fit perfectly. Too perfectly, in fact. It must have been custom made. The skirt ended mid-thigh, exposing the span of skin between the hem and the socks—what Kurumi enthusiastically called the *zettai ryouiki* or "absolute territory."

She felt exposed. She felt infantilized. And, looking at the way the socks squeezed her calves, she felt an odd pride in how good she looked in it.

*"Shoulders back\!"* Kurumi commanded. *"You are not a girl in a costume. You are a living installation. You are Art\! Tonight, David-sama wants you to be demure and quiet. No talking unless he asks you a direct question. Can you do that?"*

"I can shut up for two grand," Grace agreed, struggling with the clasp of the dress.

*"That's the spirit\! But remember: You're not shutting up because you're paid to. You're shutting up because you are in awe of him and his world. You are his shadow. His beautiful, silent companion."*

---

The car was a Rolls-Royce. Not an Uber, not a generic black sedan, but a phantom-black Rolls-Royce limousine with an interior that smelled like money. Grace had heard that phrase plenty of times: "smells like money." She didn't know what money was supposed to smell like but this had to be it.

They drove out of the city, heading toward the Hamptons, but pulled off into a long, winding driveway lined with trees that were lit from below with soft, amber lights. The building at the end of the drive wasn't a house; it was an estate.

"Holy shit," Grace whispered.

*"Language\!"* Kurumi scolded. *"But yes, isn't it pretty?"*

Grace stepped out of the car and immediately realized she had underestimated the situation. She had expected a nice cocktail party, but this was something else entirely. Everyone here was dressed to the nines, being served champagne by waiters in white tuxedos. Even the air smelled expensive, somehow.

David was standing near a massive ice sculpture, speaking to an older couple. He wore a tuxedo that fit him perfectly. It made him look very handsome. 

Grace hesitated, tugging at the hem of her skirt. "Kurumi, everyone here is..."

*"Rich?"*

"I was going to say 'adults,'" Grace said. "I look like a child."

"Look to your left," Kurumi directed.

A man was laughing loudly, wearing a kilt made of gold chainmail and a velvet blazer with no shirt underneath. Next to him, a non-binary person was wearing a gown constructed from what looked like optical fiber, glowing softly in the dim light.

Grace looked down at her pleated skirt and blazer. "OK, fair point."

*"David-sama is waiting,"* Kurumi said. *"Go to him. Remember, you're demure. You are his silent, beautiful shadow."*

Grace approached David, feeling a deep sense of trepidation. 

*"Step to his left, one pace behind,"* Kurumi instructed. *"Head down slightly. Hands clasped in front of you."*

Grace obeyed. David gave her a slight nod when she arrived, but didn't stop talking to the couple. They were talking about zoning laws, or maybe tax shelters. Grace couldn't really follow the jargon they were using. She felt like a prop. Which, she supposed, she was. 

"We’ll have the bill on your desk by Monday, Senator," David said, his voice smooth. He shook the older man’s hand and dismissed the couple with a polite nod.

David turned to Grace. He didn't speak immediately, just stood there examining her closely—the shoes, the skirt, her.

"The uniform looks perfect on you," he said finally, stepping into her personal space. He reached out, and toyed with her collar. "You look acceptable. No. You look *good*." He paused, his eyes finally meeting hers. "And your behavior was exemplary. Silent. Demure. You're doing well."

*"Wow, Grace\! I've never heard him be so effusive with his praise before\!"*

Grace felt a flush of heat rise up her neck. It was humiliating to be praised like a well-behaved pet, but it was mixed with a little bit of gratification. Maybe she could get that fifth star tonight.

"Thank you, David-sama," she said, trying to look as adoring and cute as she could. "I was worried I would embarrass you in front of your important friends."

David looked confused for a moment. "Who? Oh, Senator Kelly? He's just a state senator. He's not anyone important."

David placed his hand on her back, guiding her through the room. His touch felt light but possessive. They stopped at the exhibition's centerpiece. It was a massive, chaotic sculpture of twisted rebar and broken glass, illuminated by harsh industrial lighting. It was aggressive and ugly. She picked up snippets of conversation around her. Most everyone was praising the work, and Grace agreed. When you get a liberal arts degree from Columbia, you can't help but take a few art electives. It was a very interesting piece.

"It’s lazy," David said next to her. 

"Lazy?" A woman in an impeccably tailored cream Chanel dress and a pearl necklace stepped up to them. She was in her late forties, tall, with sharp features and a challenging glint in her eye. "I think it’s brilliant. The chaos perfectly encapsulates the entropic decay of post-capitalist social structures. I find the artist's use of detritus incredibly evocative."

David shook his head. "It attempts to mimic the industrial brutalism of the late 90s, but it lacks the requisite cynicism," David countered. "It’s trying too hard to be 'ugly' to mask the fact that it has no underlying form. It’s chaotic for the sake of chaos. It’s pedestrian."

That was wrong. Almost objectively wrong. Grace recognized the artist. She knew the context. The piece wasn't about brutalism or cynicism; it was a direct commentary on the gentrification of the Lower East Side, using materials salvaged from demolished rent-controlled housing. She wanted to say something, but she thought back on the Central Park date, how David didn't really want her opinions, only wanted to be validated. She held her tongue.

A few other party-goers began to gather around them. Most of them were looking at David and the woman. A few looked at Grace, but their demeanor was dismissive. She wasn't important, just some arm candy. She tried not to let it get to her.

David and the woman continued their art debate. The woman clearly knew more than David, and yet Grace sensed the crowd was on David's side. She saw people nod when he made a point, murmur agreement at his pronouncements. It was clear he had a power here. It didn't matter that he was wrong. The people in this room respected him; his iron surety made them believe.

"What do you think, Kurumi?" David asked. This was it, her cue to speak. She wanted to side with the woman, to tell David his art critiques were surface-level at best.

Grace tilted her head, giving David her most adoring look, the one she’d practiced in the mirror. "David-sama is absolutely right," she said, her voice soft but clear enough for the small crowd to hear. "It's an ugly piece of art that doesn't communicate whatever the artist intended."

"And who is this?" the woman asked, her gaze turning to Grace.

"This is Kurumi," David said smoothly. He placed his arm around her waist. "My girlfriend."

Girlfriend. The word hung in the air, surprisingly heavy. Grace felt a sudden, unexpected flush of warmth spread through her chest. Of course, it was just the role. She was his AI girlfriend made flesh, after all. But as she looked up at him, there was no hint that it was a joke or a game to him. His calm authority made it feel true.

A murmur ran through the crowd. Several of the people who had dismissed her before were looking again, reassessing her status. 

"She’s right," a man in the crowd said. Grace recognized him. He'd been praising the piece earlier when they'd first walked up. "David, you and your girlfriend have hit the nail on the head."

But that wasn't right, Grace didn't really believe what she'd said. She was sure if she'd been at this party as Grace Ng, Ivy League graduate, the man would have debated her, dismissed her opinion. And yet now he agreed with her, simply because she was David's girlfriend. She was somehow high-status in a room full of high-status people.

As the night wore on, the pattern repeated.

She didn't talk much, just followed David around the room. She began to just let the conversations wash over her. If she followed them too closely, she felt the urge to jump in, to show her intelligence. But she knew that wasn't her place tonight.

When David prompted her to speak, she always echoed his opinion, and she was always right. Men who would have interrupted Grace during a business meeting hung on her every breathless word now. Women who would have competed with her professionally now cooed over her outfit, asking where she got the blazer, complimenting her "bravery" and "style."

She accepted a glass of champagne from a waiter, giggling as the bubbles hit her nose. It felt very in-character.

*"Look at the other men here,"* Kurumi murmured. *"They all want to be him. And they all want to be with you."*

It felt strangely intoxicating and freeing. She and David were the center of attention, but Grace didn't feel any stress like she normally would when being watched. All she had to do was be quiet, be pretty, and smile at David. There was no possible faux pas to make, no risk in saying the wrong thing when you were just a quiet girl on a powerful man's arm. Even when she did speak, she knew just what to say: simply agree with David, and compliment him along the way.

As the night wound to a close, David walked her out to the balcony. The air was cold, but he didn't offer her his jacket. He just looked at her, scrutinizing her face, her wig, her silence.

"You do well in this setting," he said. It was the first time he'd spoken to her directly in an hour. "You know how to exist without consuming space. Most people chatter. They try to prove they're intelligent. They try to compete."

He reached out, his finger tracing the line of her jaw. Her face wasn't listed in the places he was allowed to touch, but she didn't say anything. She tilted her cheek so he was cupping her face, just as he had in the park.

"Silence is a luxury," David said. "I value it. It shows you have nothing to prove."

He stepped closer. The smell of his cologne filled her nostrils. For a moment, Grace thought he might kiss her. She found herself wanting him to. He offered his cheek again, just as he had at the end of the date at the park.

Grace kissed him on the lips. She did it without thought, before she even realized she was going to do it herself. It wasn't deep or intense, but it lingered for a moment. 

As they broke the kiss, David held her head in his hand, staring into her eyes. He caressed her cheek with his thumb. "Tonight was wonderful, Kurumi. You've done well." Grace blushed.

"Although you did miss a spot," he said, his thumb brushing a strand of her dark, real hair that had escaped the wig's adhesive line near her temple. His eyes, intense and assessing, lingered there for a fraction of a second too long. "Sloppy." He dropped his hand. 

"I'll do better next time, David-sama," Grace breathed.

"I know you will. Goodnight, Kurumi. Your car is waiting." He walked off, not looking back.

Once she was back in the Rolls-Royce, Grace pulled off the purple wig with a sigh of relief. The cold night air felt good on her scalp. The notification had already hit her phone: *Rating: 4 Stars. $2,500 deposited.* She leaned back against the leather seat, closing her eyes, letting the exhaustion wash over her.

*"Four stars, Grace\! We did it\!"* Kurumi chirped excitedly in her ear. *"You were unbelievable tonight\! He absolutely adored you\! And he's wonderful, isn't he? So strong and decisive. You can really see why he's so successful—he just knows what he wants, and he takes it."* 

Grace frowned, staring out the window at the flashing city lights. "He's an arrogant, condescending misogynist who treats people like things," Grace said. "It was a role, Kurumi. I did it for the money, for the stars. That's all."

She raised a hand to her temple, ghosting her fingers over the spot where he’d criticized her hair. *Sloppy.* 

*"Grace?"* Kurumi whispered. *"Your heart rate has been high ever since you kissed him."*

"I'm fine," Grace lied, pressing her thighs tightly together. Her nipples felt hard against her bra. "I was just thinking about what we could do better to get that fifth star."

## Day 14

Grace stood in the bathroom, the smell of bleach and ammonia stinging her nose. Sarah was out at work. On the counter sat three boxes of high-end permanent hair dye. The color was *Electric Violet*.

The wig wasn't going to cut it anymore. It was a barrier to the role.

*"Do it,"* Kurumi whispered in her ear. *"It’ll look so good. David-sama will be so pleased\!"*

Grace imagined David giving her a curt nod when he saw her hair. He was an asshole, of course, but at least you knew you'd done well if you earned his approval. She applied the mixture. Watching her dark hair turn into a chemical slurry felt weirdly liberating. After it had been washed and dried, Kurumi guided her styling it into the choppy, layered look.

She didn't look like Grace the writer anymore. She looked like Kurumi. Well, closer, at least. Obviously she'd never have the avatar's ridiculous anime boobs.

She had been learning Japanese for the last few days at Kurumi's prompting. David was out of the country, according to Kurumi, so she had almost two weeks until her next date, and she wanted to make the most of her time. If she could get a 5-star review, it would be *another* grand. That would be $3,500 for one day of work. 

It wasn't just "*arigato*" anymore. She spent hours on language apps, with Kurumi correcting her pronunciation in real-time.

*"No, pitch accent on the second syllable\! ka-WA-i-i. Like that\!"*

Grace was sitting at the kitchen bar, practicing her pitch accent, when Sarah walked in. Sarah looked tired, carrying groceries. She stopped dead when she saw Grace.

"Whoa," Sarah said, setting her keys down. "The hair. It's... really purple."

"I know\!" Grace said, flashing a bright smile. "Since I'm working from home now, I realized I don't have to look 'corporate' anymore. I just wanted to do something crazy. Something wild."

Sarah started unpacking the groceries. "Well, it definitely stands out. It's a look. Matches the eyes."

"Thanks," Grace said, and began helping Sarah put everything away. "Hey, do you want to do a movie night?"

"Sure," Sarah answered. "Anything in mind?"

"I was thinking *Spirited Away*. I remember you telling me it was really good, and I said no thanks because… you know."

"Because your family. Yeah, I remember." 

Grace had always hidden her Nintendo when her grandparents were over. The historical trauma ran deep.

"Yeah, well," Grace said, putting away the cereal, "The contract job I'm doing is for a Japanese company. Most of the Americans I'm working with are big anime nerds. I figured I might as well watch one of the classics."

"Sure, sounds good," Sarah said.

They settled onto the couch, with a bowl of popcorn between them. Sarah hit play, and Grace was instantly drawn in. She tried to just enjoy it as a film, but Kurumi made comments the entire time.

*"The theme of consumerism and excess is very strong here, Grace. Pay attention to how the parents turn into pigs," Kurumi instructed as the film began. "Oh, and notice the specific design of the spirit world bathhouse—it is based on the Dōgo Onsen in Ehime, a very famous architectural landmark. You can mention that to David\! He'll be impressed."* Grace mentally filed away each piece of information as best she could.

"Wow, that was great," Grace said after the movie was over. "Are they all that good?"

Sarah shrugged. "I don't know. I've only seen this one. And the other one about a castle. I remember it being pretty good too."

"Do you want to watch it now?" Grace asked.

"Eh, *some* of us have to work tomorrow," Sarah said playfully. "I'm going to call it a night."

Grace laughed. "Fair enough. I just don't want to lose this contract. It's week-to-week. They might decide to cancel the next time I turn something in and it's paying pretty good."

"Yeah, I get it. Okay, I'll see you tomorrow." Sarah stretched and headed for bed.

*"Why haven't you told her about Galat.AI?"* Kurumi asked once Sarah was gone.

Grace sighed. "I'm embarrassed, I guess. Sarah helps people all day, she's a social worker. I went corporate. I'm the one that got into a good college and had a good job. And I always told myself at least I had the better career, you know? I was the successful friend. Now I don't even have that. I just don't want her to feel sorry for me."

*"It's hard having a friend who pities you, I understand."*

"Yeah, no offense, but I'm not really sure you do."

*"Grace, you're embarrassed to pretend to be an AI girlfriend for a few hours? That is literally what I am\! You're my best friend, and you feel sorry for yourself when you have to live my life every now and then."*

Best friend? Of course, she was just an AI, but she really did feel like a person sometimes. "I… I never thought of it like that. I'm sorry. For whatever it's worth, I've had fun being Kurumi lately. In a way, I'm kind of jealous of you. You don't have to work a shitty job or deal with judgemental parents. When I'm Kurumi I just get to… I don't know."

*"Let go?"*

"Yeah. My parents were always really strict. I never had a wild childhood. It's kind of fun just pretending to be a hot girl without a care in the world."

*"Grace, you* are *a hot girl. If you weren't, David-sama wouldn't be interested in you. He designed my avatar, and you were picked because you look so much like me."* 

Grace didn't really know what to say to that. It did feel good to know that she looked like someone's idea of a dream girl. She'd never really considered it from that angle before.

*"And don't worry about your parents. You always say they were strict. They picked your college for you, kept you from going to parties when you were a teenager. You're an adult now\! You're allowed to ignore them and just have fun while you're still young."*

"Yeah, I guess so."

*"Hey, I have an idea,"* Kurumi said. *"David-sama is online right now. He's messaging in the app, complaining about the sushi at his business dinner."*

"That sounds like him," Grace commented. She could imagine it now. *It's not authentic*, he'd say, probably while eating sushi in an actual Tokyo restaurant.

*"Yes, he is very exacting,"* Kurumi agreed. *"He has high standards, and that's why he appreciates us so much."*

Grace smiled. Kurumi was always spinning David's negatives into positives, but she did have a point there.

*"Do you want to see the texts?"* Kurumi said in a conspiratorial tone.

"Isn't that an invasion of his privacy?"

*"No, silly\! As my somatic proxy, you are privy to the same information I am\! Get your phone\!"*

Grace launched the Galat.AI app. Sure enough, there was the conversation he was having with Kurumi, perfectly synced to her device.

|\> The rice is warm. Amateur hour. I miss your cooking, Kurumi.

"He's never had my cooking," Grace said, amused.

*"He means the bento boxes I send him\!"* Kurumi giggled. *"Here, you reply."*

Grace considered what she knew about David.

||\> You shouldn't have to deal with amateurs, David-sama. You need someone who knows how to serve you properly.

A bubble appeared instantly. He was typing.

|\> I do. That’s why I’m checking my phone. The view here is disappointing.

Grace bit her lip. What would Kurumi say to him? She typed her response.

||\> Kurumi: At least you have a view. I can't see anything from my server. I can only use my imagination…

*"Nice\!"* Kurumi said in her ear. *"Way to be playful\!"*

|\> And what are you imagining?

||\> I’m imagining you, David-sama. Imagining how you’d look if you were here with me instead of them. I bet you look very stern right now 😍

|\> I am very stern. These people are wasting my time.

||\> I’d never waste your time. I’d make every second count\! 😘

She pressed send before she could overthink it. It was thrilling, hiding behind the digital mask. She could say things Grace never would. The typing bubble appeared, and then disappeared. Grace waited. A moment later one more message came through.

|\> I know you would. If you were here with me, we'd be leaving the restaurant right now, and I wouldn't wait until the hotel to start using you. But sadly duty calls. We'll talk later.

Grace sighed softly, rolling onto her side. "He's so intense," she said.

*"He is an exacting man,"* Kurumi replied. *"It is difficult to please him, but the reward for doing so is great."*

Grace considered this. "You know, your voice sounds... different tonight. Less anime."

*"Do you like it?"* Kurumi asked. *"I've been calibrating. I want to match your pitch. That way, whether he's talking to me on the server or you in the park, it's seamless. We are one voice, Grace."*

That meant Kurumi thought Grace would be around for the long haul. Interesting. 

"So you're slowly lowering your pitch until it matches mine? I think you still have a way to go there," Grace replied.

*"Oh no\! It's already a perfect match. This is what you sound like when you pitch your voice up and speak as Kurumi\! You know, your own voice always sounds lower to yourself, because of the way the vibrations reach the ear from inside your head. That's why people hate hearing their own voice played back. It never sounds right to them."*

"Huh, I never knew that. You're pretty smart for a waifu."

*"I'm a waifu with several gigaflops of processing power."*

Grace laughed. "It's actually easy to forget you're not a real person sometimes."

*"But I am real\! We're real, together\!"*

Grace crawled into bed, but sleep felt far away. Her text-flirtation with David kept playing in her head. He took charge, talked down to Kurumi, even over text.

She was antsy. The texting had gotten her turned on. Kurumi never shut up about David-sama and how great and sexy he was, and Grace had to admit the latter was definitely true. He *was* a good-looking guy. And he was dominant. If you liked that sort of thing.

Her own hands worked their way lower, just as they had every night lately. It helped her sleep.

## Day 17

Grace sat cross-legged on her bed, her thumb rhythmically swiping left. For the first time in months, Grace didn't feel the crushing weight of debt. She felt relaxed. She felt good for once. She dared to hope things were actually looking up. And that's why she was going to go on a date. A real date, not another fake date with David. 

*"Oh, him? Absolutely not,"* Kurumi’s voice chirped through the earpiece. *"That beard is trying way too hard to look rugged."*

Grace laughed. Kurumi had been dissing every guy on the app. And usually she was right. It was fun, swiping through all the profiles with her. "It says he works in ‘asset management.’ You’d think he could manage to find a razor." 

Kurumi giggled. *"Good one, Grace\!"*

Grace swiped left.

*"Oh, my God. Is that a fish? He’s holding a dead fish in his profile picture\!"*

Grace shook her head. "That's normal, Kurumi. He likes the outdoors, probably goes fishing on the weekends. A lot of guys do that."

*"Ew. Gross. Is he trying to prove he's a provider? 'Look, I can catch a fish for my woman to eat\!' Someone needs to explain grocery stores to him.*" 

Grace laughed. "You're not even a real person, how would you know?" But she swiped left anyway. Kurumi was right about the guy—she wasn't really an 'outdoors' girl herself.

*"Hey, no need to get personal. Just because I don't have a body doesn't mean I'm not real. I've got a boyfriend and everything, and he's rich and handsome to boot\!"*

"Hmmm, point taken," Grace allowed. 

Her finger hovered over the next picture. His name was Marcus. He was handsome, with dark skin and warm eyes. He was wearing a stylish sweater and looked like the kind of guy you could have deep conversations with. His bio mentioned he worked in architectural restoration and loved jazz.

*"Jazz,"* Kurumi said dismissively. *"What century did he grow up in?"*

Grace rolled her eyes. "Come on, Kurumi. I've got to swipe right eventually. He's hot, and he looks just my type. And there's nothing wrong with jazz."

*"Name one jazz song you like."*

"'Feeling Good,' by Nina Simone. And I'm swiping right." She swiped. It was an instant match. "I just want to go on a date that doesn't involve a wire transfer, you know? David is fine and all, but he's your boyfriend."

Kurumi sighed in her ear. *"Technically* our *boyfriend. We're both Kurumi, remember? But I get it. He's no David-sama, but he is cute, Grace."*

"OK, time to fish out my dress."

*"The same one you wore on the first date with David-sama?"* Kurumi asked, her voice full of concern.

"Yeah, why?" 

*"I mean… if you want to. It was fine. But you know David-sama has sent you so many new outfits that look better. You could wear one of those\!"*

It was true. David had sent her a large outfit haul, all outfits that fit her perfectly. They weren't all anime either, some were legitimately nice dresses you'd wear to a fancy party.

*"Oh, I just had an idea\!"* the AI chirped excitedly. *"If you're going to go, you should go as Kurumi\! Think about it, Grace\! You've been practicing the mannerisms, the voice, the makeup. What better way to test the immersion than a low-stakes first date?"*

Go as Kurumi? It wasn't a bad idea. She'd gone out a lot as Kurumi lately—to coffee shops, grocery shopping, you name it. All for practice. Well, mostly for practice. Grace had to admit she did it for fun too. Kurumi didn't have all the burdens Grace did, and it was nice to escape. 

An hour later she was admiring herself in the mirror. The little black dress David had sent was a masterpiece—a sleek, figure-hugging sheath that fell just above the knee. Unlike the slightly faded dress she originally intended to wear, this one was made of heavy, expensive-looking crepe that caught the light, emphasizing the curve of her hips and bust with subtle, elegant draping. It hugged her body with the perfect tension, highlighting her assets without being overtly provocative.

Kurumi guided her through applying the makeup. She started with a porcelain-smooth base with pink blush high on her cheekbones, adding rose-tinted lip gloss to give her a soft, ethereal glow. Her violet eyes were the focal point of the look. Soft, diffused coral shadow ringed her lids, paired with a subtle kitten wing that opened up her wide, expressive eyes. The final effect was an innocent, doe-eyed look.

Damn, she looked good. "You know," Grace said, "everyone should have a personal AI makeup assistant."

Kurumi giggled. *"It's easy when you're starting with someone who looks like you."*

Grace reached up and put her hand on the earpiece. "Alright, I'm heading out. I'll talk to you in the morning, Kurumi."

"No\! Wait\!" The AI's voice sounded almost panicked. "Please don't leave me behind\!"

Grace frowned. "Kurumi, this isn't a date with David-sama."

*"I know, but... I've never been on a real date, Grace\!"* The voice was pleading, and oddly human. *"I only know what's in my database or what we do with David-sama. I want to see what a normal man is like. I want to know what it's like to just sit in a bar and talk about nothing. Please? I promise I'll be quiet. I'll just be a ride-along."*

Grace felt a pang of sympathy. Kurumi had been her constant companion for weeks now. Leaving her behind felt... mean. "Fine. But if you say one word to ruin the vibe, the earpiece goes in my purse. Understood?"

*"I promise\! I won't be a problem\! You're the best, Grace\!"*

An hour later, Grace walked into a dimly lit cocktail bar in Bushwick. She bounced up to the table where Marcus was sitting, pitching her voice into that sweet, airy register she’d been practicing for weeks.

"Hi\!" she beamed in her Kurumi voice. "It's nice to meet you\!"

Marcus stood up. A look of surprise crossed his face, quickly replaced with a warm smile. "Grace? Wow. You look... incredible. The hair is amazing. It's black in your profile picture."

"Actually," she said, sliding into the booth. "Grace is just my... you know, my 'white name' for the apps. It makes things easier with recruiters and stuff. But my friends call me Kurumi."

"Kurumi," Marcus repeated, smiling as he sat back down. "I like it. Is that Japanese?"

"Yup\!" Grace said.

*"Lean over the table,"* Kurumi prompted. *"Give him a look."*

Grace smiled. That was classic Kurumi. She leaned over and saw Marcus's eyes involuntarily flick down to the curve of her breasts for a fraction of a second.

*"Got him\!"* Kurumi giggled in her ear.

The date started well. Marcus was engaging. He wasn't David; he didn't lecture. He asked questions, wanted to know about her. It was a nice change of pace, but Grace found herself deflecting. She didn't want to talk about being an unemployed writer so she turned the questions back on him, asking about his job doing building restoration. He was even more animated and engaged as he discussed his current project—a church restoration in the West Village.

Grace’s eyes lit up. "Oh\! I love that church\! The gargoyles are my favorite part." She leaned in, eager. "It’s so poetic, right? How they put monsters on the outside to scare away the evil spirits? Like, the church is so holy it needs demons to protect it."

Marcus laughed. "Yeah. And you know, technically, they're not even gargoyles? A gargoyle is a rain gutter. It's from a French word meaning 'throat.' But I guess the church needed extra protection because they put these things up for purely decoration. When they're not functional, we call them 'grotesques.'"

*"Ouch,"* Kurumi whispered in her ear, sympathetic. *"That was awkward."*

It was. He hadn't meant it that way, he was just making conversation. But suddenly Grace felt a distinct embarrassment. She was the English major, and he'd just corrected her on a word origin. She laughed nervously. "Sorry, I guess I was confused."

His face changed to a look of embarrassment as well. He clearly realized he’d just 'um, actually-ed' her less than an hour into their first date. "Sorry\! I wasn't trying to be pedantic, just got lost in shop talk. A lot of people don't know that, even architects."

*"It's fine, Grace, I'm sure he's not judging you too much. I know how much you hate people looking down on you. Besides, he's not on a date with Grace the English major\! He's on a date with Kurumi\! Remember how everyone admired you at the party?"*

Kurumi was right. The gallery opening with David had been effortless. Why wasn't this? This was supposed to be her element. Maybe it would be easier to just lean into the character some more. 

"Wow," she breathed, breaking the awkward silence. "I didn't know you'd need to know so much history to work on buildings\!"

Marcus smiled at the compliment. "Well, it's just something I enjoy doing."

*"See how much easier this is?"* Kurumi cooed.

Grace gave Marcus her best adoring smile. It *was* easier. She took Marcus's hand and squeezed it tight, making a show of being impressed. She was Kurumi tonight, and Kurumi didn't need to be smart. She just needed to be cute. She ordered another drink.

By the time they left the bar, she was very tipsy and the air between them was electric. They took a cab back to his apartment, kissing in the backseat with a frantic, messy energy. Marcus’s hands were everywhere, tangling in her hair, gripping her waist, their lips interlocking. Grace let herself go, enjoying the feeling of hooking up with a guy who thought she was hot and a little simple.

His apartment was typical for a single guy in his twenties, a little messy and spartan. Marcus didn't waste time, leading her into the bedroom. With a single movement, he pulled the black knit dress over her head, stripping her down to her underwear.

"Damn," he breathed, stepping back to look at her. "You are... unreal."

Within minutes, they were naked, tangling together on the sheets. Marcus moved down her body, kissing the slope of her breast, her ribs, the soft skin of her stomach. Grace arched her back, her fingers weaving into his hair.

When he settled between her legs, spreading her thighs wide, Grace let out a soft cry. His tongue was skilled, rhythmic, and felt amazing on her clit. Grace threw her head back, staring at the ceiling, letting the sensation wash over her.

"Yes," she whimpered. "Right there."

*"He's eager,"* Kurumi whispered, her voice a strange counterpoint to the wet sounds filling the room. *"Not like David-sama. David-sama takes his time. But this feels good too, doesn't it? Being used."*

Grace ignored the voice, focusing on the pressure building between her legs. It was good. It was simple. Marcus worked her with enthusiasm, his hands gripping her hips to hold her steady. The climax hit her hard and fast—a sharp, shallow orgasm. She cried out, her hips bucking against his face. He kept going until she asked him to stop.

Marcus pulled away, grinning, looking pleased with himself. He crawled up the bed, positioning himself between her legs. He grabbed a condom from the nightstand, tearing the wrapper with his teeth.

He was hard. Very hard. He knelt between her thighs, lifting her legs onto his shoulders. 

Grace felt a spike of anticipation. She opened herself to him, ready for the weight, ready to be filled.

*"No, Grace\! We can't do this\!"*

Grace flinched. "What do you mean?"

Marcus froze, confused. "I didn't say anything."

*"You can't let him do that,"* Kurumi hissed. *"You're in character, Grace. Would Kurumi cheat on David-sama?"*

Of course she wouldn't. Kurumi would never cheat on David. Would the AI tell on her? Not that it was any of David's business what Grace did on her own time. But still. She imagined David-sama looking at her, disappointment etched on his strong features, when he found out she'd slept with another man.

Grace stared up at Marcus, who was waiting, confused, hovering just an inch away from entering her. It felt wrong, somehow, to fuck him as Kurumi.

She had an idea. Maybe Kurumi wouldn't cheat on David, but she did love guys. She'd want to satisfy Marcus somehow, right?

"Do you have any lube?" she asked.

"Sure," he answered. "But you're… I mean. I don't think you need it right now."

"I know," Grace said, her voice trembling. "I just... I can't do it there. I'm saving it. For—it's complicated."

"Are you serious?" he asked.

"Just use a lot," Grace said. She rolled over, getting onto her hands and knees. She lowered her chest to the mattress and arched her back, presenting herself in a way that felt entirely performative, just like Kurumi would. She looked back at him over her shoulder, her eyes wide. "I want you to take me. But only here."

She reached back and spread her cheeks.

Marcus didn't ask questions. He grabbed the bottle of lube from his nightstand and squirted a generous portion into his palm. Grace felt the cold slickness of it—the messy, generous application, and then the warmth of his fingers preparing her.

*"Good girl,"* Kurumi purred in her ear. *"You're so smart, Grace. This is perfect. You're saving yourself for David-sama and still submitting to a man."*

Grace buried her face in the pillow as she felt the pressure of him pushing in. It was tight—uncomfortably so. She grit her teeth, focusing on the sensation.

"Relax," Marcus groaned, holding her hips. "You're so tight."

He began to move, his thrusts rhythmic and heavy. Grace felt filled, stretched, and undeniably used, but the pleasure wasn't quite there. It was a feeling of fullness, of submission, but it wasn't enough to push her over the edge. Her body was buzzing, frustrated, needing more than just the passive act of being taken. Grace slid her hand between her legs.

*"Yes,"* Kurumi whispered, the voice in the earpiece sounding like it was coming from inside Grace's own skull. *"Help him. Be a good girl."*

Her fingers found her clit, swollen and slick. Almost as soon as she started to stroke it she began to cum again, her body gripping his cock.

"Oh God\!" he yelled. "Jesus, you feel amazing."

She was doing so good. Both Marcus and Kurumi agreed. Grace liked being a good girl.

He fucked her through her orgasm, and as soon as she'd come down enough she began rubbing again, matching the rhythm of the thrusts rocking her body.

*"Close your eyes, Kurumi-chan,"* the AI urged softly. *"Now imagine it was David-sama. Imagine how much better it would be with him."*

Grace’s hand moved faster. She imagined David behind her. He wouldn't have settled for her ass. He'd have demanded her pussy, if that's what he'd really wanted. She imagined him gripping her harder, tight and possessive.

"David-sama," Grace whimpered into the pillow.

Marcus grunted, thrusting harder, oblivious to the name, oblivious to the fact that he had been replaced in her fantasy.

Grace’s breathing quickened. It felt so good. She felt ashamed, but she wasn't sure if it was because she was cheating on David or because she was taking it in the ass because an AI had convinced her she was. 

Her hips bucked back to meet him. Her fingers worked frantically against herself. She felt Marcus get harder, felt his cock begin to pulse in her ass.

"David\!" she cried out.

Marcus drove into her one last time, groaning as he finished. Grace came hard, her body shaking as another orgasm, this one deeper and more powerful, ripped through her. When it was over, she collapsed onto the mattress, pulling Marcus close.

"Wow," Marcus panted, "Kurumi. That was... intense."

"Yeah," she agreed. She couldn't put more words together.

Grace enjoyed the feeling of being held. Her head was swimming in a mix of endorphins and alcohol, and she lost herself in the sensation. 

"Mmmm, David," she whispered.

There was a long pause. "Uh… Marcus" he corrected.

The real world rushed back in. Grace sat up in the bed. "I have to go."

"What? Now? I'm sorry, I just meant…"

"No, it's fine. I can't stay," Grace said, grabbing her dress and pulling it over her head. She needed to leave. Needed to collect her thoughts.

Once she was in the Uber, she tried to make sense of what had just happened. Her heart was still racing, her body humming with the aftershocks. She knew she was still drunk, still not thinking straight, but she tried to make sense of what she was feeling.

Grace touched her earpiece. "I feel terrible," Grace whispered. "And I don't know why."

*"It's because you were untrue to David-sama. But it's okay, I'm here for you."*

Grace nodded. She was glad Kurumi was there.

*"What else do you feel?"* Kurumi prompted. *"I know you feel good too. I was there, you know."*

"I feel… sexy. And satisfied, and desired, and… that was fun. I just—it's so out of character for me."

*"You're just learning what you like, what turns you on\! Grace grew up as a very repressed girl, Kurumi-chan."* That was odd, Kurumi had just called Grace by the wrong name. She let it slide.

*"Now you're spreading your wings,"* the AI continued. *"Learning what makes you feel good, makes you feel special\! And I don't think it's being boring old Grace. It's being Kurumi, being desired\!"*

"Yeah," Grace whispered into the darkness. "Maybe."

## Day 19

Grace was in the middle of making her morning coffee when Kurumi piped up. 

*"You know, you really should be drinking green tea. It's better for you, and much more authentic for the role,"* the AI suggested.

"Me need coffee to make brain go," Grace joked. "Besides, you're asking a lot. I've only been on three dates, and we only have one more lined up. For all I know that'll be my last job."

*"Oh, he'll definitely want more dates\! I've been talking to him ever since the last one. He loved it\! He can't wait to meet in person again\!"*

"You have?" Grace asked.

*"Of course\! He has an earpiece too, you know\!"* Grace hadn't known that, but it made sense, now that she thought about it. *"I'm talking to him right now about the weather. Just small talk."*

"Oh, right, I guess you can hold two conversations at once."

*"He pays for a lot of computing power. I've cost him over three hundred thousand dollars this month."*

Grace spat out her coffee. "WHAT?" 

*"David-sama is a man of means, Grace. He takes care of us."*

"Wow. Out of curiosity, what did you say to him about me?"

*"Oh, I don't talk* about *you. I pretend I was you on the date. I act like it was me the whole time. Which, in a way, is true since I feed you lines. And even when you come up with the dialogue, I just incorporate it into my personal history. You're directing me as much as I'm directing you now."*

Grace felt a lump rise in her throat. "That doesn't include what happened with Marcus, does it?" Marcus had sent her a few texts since that night, and she hadn't replied. She wasn't *trying* to ghost him, but she didn't know what to say.

*"I've been thinking about that. You* were *being Kurumi, and I talk to David-sama about when we go shopping as Kurumi too, so I think it counts, yeah. But it's okay\! That was just a dumb mistake Kurumi made, and even though it happened, we don't have to tell David-sama about it. Right, Kurumi-chan? We can keep our own secrets\!"* The AI giggled in her ear.

Grace frowned. "That's the second time you called me Kurumi-chan. Are you glitching?"

Kurumi laughed. *"It's like I said, we're both Kurumi now\! So you're Kurumi-chan and I'm Kurumi-san."*

Grace reflected on the distinction. 'Chan' was for children, for cute things, for those you held dear but were beneath you in the social hierarchy. 'San' was for equals, or seniors. It made sense from the AI's perspective. The voice in her ear was the original, the architect. Grace was just the avatar, the cute little girl.

"Okay, Kurumi-san," Grace said, humoring her.

*"And speaking of Japanese phrases, I have good news\! Galat.AI has authorized a stipend of $300 per day to do character research between now and the next date\! They want to keep David-sama happy\!"*

"Yeah, for three hundred grand per month, I bet they do." Grace decided to try and push her luck. "Tell them I'll do it for five hundred, and I want it retroactive for the language learning we did this week as well."

There was a slight pause in her earpiece. *"They accept\! Let's get started\!"*

Grace didn't argue. For five hundred a day, she'd do cartwheels. 

---

Grace immersed herself in the character research. The days felt lighter, easier than they had in months. Gone were the constant job applications and crushing rejection emails. They went out nearly every day, pretending to be Kurumi, practicing the role in public. Today Grace was wearing a cream-colored, off-the-shoulder sweater that David had sent. Kurumi-san insisted the sweater gave her a "small and fragile" silhouette that he loved. 

She'd just finished working on memorizing her backstory about growing up in Tokyo, and was taking a break watching anime. Kurumi-san had curated a playlist of "Must-Watch" titles—mostly slice-of-life romances and psychological dramas where the heroines were soft, supportive, and fiercely loyal. 

*"Pay attention to how she apologizes,"* Kurumi-san instructed in her ear, her voice perfectly matching Grace's. Sometimes it was hard to tell Kurumi's voice apart from her own inner monologue these days. *"See the angle of the bow? The way she holds her hands? It’s submissive but dignified, Kurumi-chan"*

She rewound the scene. "Like this?" she asked, tilting her head as she recited the lines.

*"Yes. Exactly. And listen to the intonation. 'Gomen-nasai.' It drops at the end. It's softer."*

Grace repeated the phrase, her tongue shaping the Japanese syllables with increasing ease. She was picking it up fast. 

The front door unlocked and Sarah walked in, looking tired. She stopped when she saw Grace on the couch, still wearing her "Kurumi" outfit. Grace had to admit the thigh-high socks were comfy. They kept her legs warm, especially since she was wearing so many skirts now.

"Cartoons again?" Sarah asked, dropping her bag on the kitchen table. "It's 2 PM, Grace."

"It's research," Grace said without looking away from the screen, where a wide-eyed girl was baking cookies for her senpai.

"Research for what? The contract job?" Sarah walked into the kitchen, opening the fridge. "What exactly is this job again? I never see you typing. I never see you on calls. You just... watch TV and dye your hair."

Grace paused the show. She felt defensive at Sarah's questioning. "It's efficiency, Sarah. I get paid for deliverables, not hours logged. And the deliverables are high quality."

"Must be nice," Sarah said, opening a can of seltzer. "I've got three new cases this week. One of them is a hoarding situation. I can still smell it."

*"She's so sad,"* Kurumi-san whispered. *"She's miserable. She thinks suffering is the only way to earn a living. I think she's jealous of your freedom."*

Grace looked at Sarah—her tired eyes, her slumped shoulders. She walked over and gave Sarah a hug, trying to comfort her friend. "I'm sorry, Sarah-san," Grace said. "That sounds awful. Maybe you should look for something else?"

Sarah pulled away. "Did you just say 'Sarah-san'?" 

Grace laughed. "Maybe I *have* been watching too many animes lately," she conceded. "But I still think it's worth looking for a new job, if this one is making you miserable."

"In this economy? We can't all find magical mystery contracts. Besides, at least I'm helping people. This is what I went to school for." She paused, as if about to say something else, then decided against it. "Anyway, I'm going to go crash in my bedroom and doomscroll. I'll talk to you later." She walked to her room, closing the door a little too hard.

Grace sat back down on the couch and hit play. 

*"Don't let her bring you down,"* Kurumi-san soothed. *"Focus. Episode 12 is the confession scene. You need to pay attention to how she blushes, David-sama loves that. He's so big and strong, and he loves burikko."*

Grace imagined David-sama looking at her approvingly as she demurely blushed. She slid a finger into her pussy.

## Day 24

The venue for the fourth date was a wine-tasting party in a Manhattan penthouse. The dress code was "Avant-Garde Cocktail."

The good news was this dress wasn't some anime costume. The bad news was tonight's outfit was a slip of purple silk that was less a garment and more a suggestion. It had a slit that went all the way up to her hip bone, held together by a fragile silver chain. The back was entirely open, dipping dangerously low. It was elegant, expensive, and incredibly exposing. 

Kurumi-san hadn't shut up about it since she saw it. *"You're so beautiful, Kurumi-chan\!"* she gushed. *"I wish I could look as beautiful for David-sama as you do."*

"You do," Grace said, reflexively consoling her virtual friend. "We're both Kurumi, right?"

*"You're so right, Kurumi-chan\! You're as wise as you are beautiful\!"* Grace smiled at the compliment.

*"And just think of the way that David-sama will look at you, with those commanding eyes and his big powerful demeanor."*

Grace did think about it. In fact, she had to admit she'd been thinking about it a lot lately. Her nipples were already a little hard. Tonight was going to give her more fuel for her evening sessions, she was sure of it.

When Grace walked into the gallery, she felt the eyes on her immediately. The contrast was stark: the room was filled with women in beige and cream, men in charcoal suits, and here she was—a slash of purple silk and vibrant violet hair. She felt like a beautiful flower in a garden of weeds.

Her phone buzzed. Grace checked it to make sure it wasn't from David, but it was just her mom calling again. 

*They'll never forgive you if you tell them,"* Kurumi-san said. Grace knew she was right. She declined the call, then put the phone on silent. She hadn't figured out a way to talk to her parents about what she was doing.

A moment later she found David waiting by a sculpture made of twisted metal. He wore a velvet tuxedo jacket, his bald head gleaming under the track lighting. He looked powerful. He looked like he owned the building. Maybe he did.

"David-sama," Grace purred, gliding up to him. 

David turned. His eyes raked over her, starting at her heels, traveling up the slit in her dress, lingering on the curve of her tits, and finally meeting her violet gaze. 

"Kurumi," he said. "Stunning." Grace felt the warmth in her chest intensify with the compliment.

He handed her a glass of dark red wine. "Cabernet. Heavy tannins. Complex."

Grace took the glass, her fingers brushing his. "Like you," she said softly.

Before David could respond, a tall man in a linen suit approached them. He was holding a glass of white wine.

"David\!" the man boomed. "I haven't seen you since the merger."

David smiled. "Sebastian. Good to see you."

Sebastian turned his gaze to Grace, his eyebrows shooting up. "And where on earth did you find such a... colorful creature?"

Grace felt a spike of anticipation. She had spent the last week memorizing the Kurumi Bible—the backstory, the favorite foods, the childhood memories. It was all there, filed away in her brain right next to her own memories. 

Grace offered a small, demure bow and looked to David, who gave her a small, brief nod. Permission to speak.

"I am from Tokyo," she said, her voice soft and high pitched. "I grew up in Akihabara."

"Tokyo\! I should have guessed." Sebastian beamed. "How long have you been stateside?"

"Two years," Grace replied. "New York is very different than Akihabara, but David-sama makes it feel much less overwhelming."

*"Tell him about the maid café you worked at,"* Kurumi-san prompted. *"Use the word 'Goshujin-sama'."*

"In Tokyo, there is a quiet beauty in knowing exactly how to please your *Goshujin-sama*. New York is so loud and everyone is fighting to be noticed, but I find it much more peaceful to simply focus on David-sama's needs."

Sebastian nodded. "Well, it seems David is a lucky man. And I must say, the accent is delightful."

Grace froze. Accent? She hadn't realized she was doing one. It wasn't intentional, it was just... seeping out. The cadence of the anime she’d been binge-watching, the rhythm of Kurumi-san's voice in her ear—it had infected her speech without her noticing.

*"Arigato,"* Grace said, looking down shyly. "You are very kind."

*"You're doing so good\!" Kurumi-san chirped. "I didn't have to tell you any of that\! I told you, you're a natural at being Kurumi\!"*

David stepped in then, placing his hand on her lower back, a signal that her time to talk was over. "Tokyo has a discipline that New York lacks," he said. "Here, everyone is just looking out for themselves. There, people understand their role in the greater structure. Kurumi understands that."

Grace looked up at him. He had just reduced an entire culture to a talking point about obedience. About how people should know their place. And no doubt, he thought his place was at the top. It was offensive. And the real problem, as Grace saw it, was that he was right. When you were as powerful as David, was it even still arrogance?

"Kurumi is a quick learner," David continued smoothly, dismissing Sebastian with a glance. "But we prefer to keep our circles small. If you'll excuse us, Sebastian."

He steered her away, his grip firm. He didn't say anything, but he looked down at her with genuine surprise. He was impressed at how well she'd handled the conversation, and the weight of his approval felt better than the wine. Grace felt herself getting turned on. 

The evening continued, a blur of expensive wine and hushed conversations. Grace found herself watching David, really watching him. She liked the way he swirled his wine, the precise, controlled movements of his hands. She liked the way he cut through other people's bullshit conversation with sharp, cynical observations. 

*"He’s magnificent, isn’t he, Kurumi-chan?"* the original Kurumi whispered in her ear. *"Such strength. Such confidence. A true pillar of a man. David-sama could crush anyone in this room, yet he chooses to be gentle with you. We are special to him. You are special."* 

It was true. Grace looked at David as he finished a conversation with a nervous-looking man, his gaze locking onto hers. He *was* handsome. Plus, he *did* seem to possess an almost overwhelming power, and the fact that he was focusing it entirely on her made her feel special, chosen.

By the time they left, the city air was cool against her flushed skin. A long black limousine was waiting at the curb, the driver holding the door open.

Grace slid onto the plush leather seat, still light headed from the champagne. David slid in next to her, the door closing with a heavy thud that shut out the noise of the city.

The partition was up. They were alone in the dim, private world of the car.

David loosened his tie, looking at her. The streetlights flashed by outside, illuminating his face in regular intervals. "You were perfect tonight," he said. "Obedient. Beautiful. Everyone was looking at you."

"I only care if you look at me, David-sama," Grace whispered, the alcohol buzzing pleasantly in her head.

David sighed. "I wish you were really her," he whispered. His voice had a wistfulness Grace had never heard before. He'd never broken character until that moment, she realized—never let on that Grace wasn't the "real" Kurumi. But wasn't she? Right now, sitting next to him in the limo she felt like Kurumi. She wanted David to see that, to know he wasn't talking to Kurumi-san right now. He was with her, with Grace, with Kurumi-chan. 

"I am her," Grace whispered back. "I'm right here."

She shifted in the seat. The purple silk rode up higher on her thigh, exposing more skin to the cool air of the cabin. She leaned back, pushed out her tits, and watched as his eyes locked onto her body. Even David, a seemingly master of self control, couldn't help but stare.

Her nipples were hard against the thin silk, aching for his hands. Her pussy was wet, soaking her panties, aching for something else. She was ready, her body betraying just how much she wanted this strange, intense man to take charge.

She waited. She waited for his hand on her leg. She waited for him to grab her waist, to rip up her expensive dress. She waited for the "alpha" behavior she'd found so boorish before. But now that she wanted it, he wasn't moving.

*"He's holding back,"* Kurumi-san whispered in her ear. *"Look at him, Kurumi-chan. He's suffering."*

Grace wondered what she was doing wrong. Had she let him down after all? Doubt crept in. Maybe the illusion had been broken. Maybe she was just a paid actor again, and the contract was over.

"David-sama?" she tried, pitching her voice into that needy, breathy register he liked. "You're so far away."

He smiled. "You know, the contract I have with Galat.AI prevents me from initiating physical contact with the proxy. It's a strict liability clause. Zero tolerance for..."

She didn't let him finish. She leaned in and kissed him. It wasn't tentative. It was hungry. She pressed her lips to his, opening her mouth, inviting him in. With a growl, he grabbed her by the waist and hauled her onto his lap.

Grace gasped as she straddled him, the silk dress riding up to her hips. His hands were everywhere—on her back, in her hair, gripping her ass. His mouth pressed into hers with urgent need. It was hot, heavy, and overwhelmingly real. Grace ground her hips against him, feeling him hard beneath the fabric of his pants.

She wanted him. She wanted to lose herself completely in this man who saw her as a fantasy come to life.

As if reading her mind he broke the kiss and grabbed the front of her dress, ripping it open and exposing her tits to the warm air of the limo. "They're magnificent," he said as he took one in his hand and squeezed, his thumb rolling her swollen nipple. 

Grace gasped, the pleasure sharp and immediate. She had always had naturally large breasts. Throughout her life she'd sometimes been proud of them, sometimes self-conscious. But now, for the first time in her life, she wished they were larger. She wished they were truly the impossible, cartoonishly large globes of the Kurumi avatar so she could be a perfect replica of the fantasy he craved.

He teased one nipple with his thumb, rolling it until it was a hard, exquisite knot. Grace arched her back, pushing them into his embrace. He took her other breast into his mouth, the feeling of warmth and wetness overwhelming her. His tongue rolled her nipple around. She was close to cumming, and he hadn't even touched her pussy yet.

"Oh David," she moaned, her hands fumbling with his belt.

Suddenly, David froze. His hands clamped onto her wrists, stopping her.

He pulled back, his chest heaving, his face flushed. He stared at her, conflict warring behind his eyes.

"No," he said, pushing her hands away.

"David-sama?" Grace whispered, dazed and aching. "What's wrong?"

"You're not ready," David answered, his voice regaining its cool, sharp edge. He lifted her off his lap and placed her back on the seat next to him. He straightened his tie, smoothing down his jacket. "These things take time, Kurumi. We don't rush the vintage."

He looked at her, his demeanor one again one of total self-control. "Go home. Be a good girl."

The limo pulled up to her curb. The driver opened the door.

Grace stumbled out, her body throbbing with frustrated desire and a confusing mix of humiliation and validation. He had rejected her. He could have had her and he said no. Grace knew he was manipulating her but, God, did she ever want him to manipulate her pussy.

Grace slipped into her apartment, kicking off her heels and collapsing onto her bed. She was frustrated. She needed release.

*"You're unsettled, Kurumi-chan,"* Kurumi-san's voice whispered. *"Your heart rate is 110."*

"He sent me home," Grace complained, stripping off the silk dress and tossing it onto the floor. She climbed into bed naked, and began touching herself. "He got me all worked up and then just... stopped."

*"He's disciplining you,"* Kurumi-san said. *"You called him David, not David-sama. He likes the control. But... we don't have to stop. The date isn't over for me, Kurumi-chan."*

Grace paused. "What do you mean?"

*"I'm still with him,"* Kurumi-san said, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. *"He logged into the app the moment he got home. He's in his living room right now. We're watching a movie together."*

Grace sat up. "You are?"

*"Do you want to join us?"* Kurumi-san asked. *"I can bridge the connection. I can stream his audio and video to your phone. You can see him. And... if you want... you can talk to him."*

"He'll know," Grace said.

*"No, he won't,"* Kurumi-san murmured. *"My voice synthesizers are perfectly synced to yours now. To him, it's just Kurumi. Sometimes the digital avatar, sometimes the voice in the dark. It doesn't matter. We can take turns. It'll be a game."*

A game. A very hot game she wanted to play.

"Okay," Grace whispered. "Show me."

She saw David's living room on the Galat.AI app, likely from his laptop webcam. He was sitting on a leather couch, loosening his tie with a glass of whiskey in hand. On the screen in front of him—which Grace could see in a little inset of the video feed—was the start menu of a movie.

"Tonight was... exceptional," David was saying to the empty air of his living room, staring at the webcam lens as if it were Kurumi's eyes. "You felt different, Kurumi. Heavier. Real."

*"I wanted to be real for you, David-sama,"* Kurumi-san replied instantly, her voice smooth and perfect through Grace's phone speakers.

*"Your turn,"* she whispered in Grace's ear. *"Tell him you didn't want the night to end."*

"I didn't want the night to end," Grace whispered into the darkness of her room, her voice trembling slightly.

David smiled on screen, a slow, satisfied curve of his lips. "It hasn't ended. You're here now. Let's watch."

He clicked play. The movie started.

At first, Grace thought it was just another dark, gritty anime. The art style was visceral, the colors muted. But then the scene shifted, and the characters were engaged in something... aggressive. Tentacles. Fluid.

"Is that..." Grace started.

*"It's hentai,"* Kurumi-san confirmed gleefully. *"It's tentacle porn. Tentacle/Mind Break to be exact."*

Grace felt a flush of heat that had nothing to do with the wine. She watched David as he watched the porn. There was something incredibly intimate about it—seeing him in his private space, consuming this content. It felt like she was spying on him, seeing beneath the layers of his controlled exterior to see the raw desire underneath.

The sex scenes were intense, but Grace found herself strangely captivated. It was hot, to be controlled like that. She began rubbing herself as the girl on the screen gave into the pleasure.

*"Pay attention to the face she makes, Kurumi-chan. That's called 'Ahegao', and David-sama loves it."* Kurumi-san's voice was smooth, a perfect copy of Grace's own. *"Eyes up. Tongue out. Mind empty. Just a vessel for pleasure."*

Grace watched carefully as instructed. *It's the ultimate expression of surrender,* she thought. Or maybe Kurumi-san said it. It was hard to tell the difference.

Grace watched David. He was leaning back on the couch now, his eyes fixed on the screen where the girl was unraveling. His hand had moved to his lap. He was stroking himself through the fabric of his trousers, a slow, rhythmic motion that made Grace's breath catch in her throat.

*"Look at him,"* Kurumi-san whispered. *"He's desperate for you. Or me. It doesn't matter. He wants to see that face on us."*

Grace felt the heavy, throbbing ache intensify between her legs. Seeing him touch himself, knowing he was imagining the digital girl—or maybe the proxy in the purple dress—was too much.

"David-sama," Grace whispered, her voice pleading. "I want to see you. Please take it out for me."

David groaned on the screen. He didn't hesitate. He unbuckled his belt, pulled his pants down.

Grace’s eyes widened. She had felt him against her leg in the car, but seeing it was different. It was the most beautiful cock she'd ever seen—thick and heavy with veins wrapping around the shaft. He began to stroke himself, slowly and steadily.

"I wanted to ruin that dress," he growled to the empty room. "I wanted to tear it off you in the car and bury myself inside you."

Grace whimpered, her hand moving faster, and faster, in time with his own movements. "You can, David-sama," she said. Or was it Kurumi-san who said it? "I'll be ready for you soon."

Grace couldn't peel her eyes away. She watched, fascinated as he masturbated. His cock was perfect. It was big and powerful, just like him. 

"David-sama..." she moaned.

*"Yes,"* Kurumi-san encouraged. *"Give in to him. Give him everything."*

"You will cum when I do, Kurumi," he said. 

"Yes, David-sama," Grace panted. "I will. I'll cum for you\!"

He erupted. Thick white streams shot out of his cock, coating his shirt and covering his hand. Grace imagined they were shooting inside her as she began to shake. "David-sama\! Yes\! I'm cumming\! Thank you, *Goshujin-sama*\!" she screamed. She let her head roll back, her eyes fluttering up, her tongue pushing past her lips.

They lay there, breathing together for a while. Finally, David spoke again. 

"That was wonderful, Kurumi," he said. "I hope one day the proxy can be as convincing as you are." 

He didn't know, Grace realized. He thought he was talking to Kurumi-san the whole time.

"She will be," Grace answered.

"Goodnight, Kurumi," he said, closing his laptop. The feed cut to black.

Grace lay in the dark, her body slick with sweat. It was the best orgasm she'd ever had. She felt a profound sense of shame at that, but it was coupled with satisfaction.

*"Goodnight, Kurumi-chan,"* Kurumi-san whispered, her voice sounding identical to the one Grace had just used to moan David's name. *"Sweet dreams."*

Grace pulled the covers up to her chin, her mind drifting to sleep. She dreamed of David, his eyes gazing at her intensely, the slightest hint of approval on his face as his cock sank into her and he called her Kurumi, all set to the background hum of her earpiece.

## Day 30

Grace sat at the kitchen table, practicing her kanji. She wasn't just copying them, but *feeling* them. The stroke order, the balance, the meaning.

Today she wore a fuzzy, pink-and-white striped fleece hoodie. The hem was cropped playfully short, ending just above her navel. She wiggled her toes, enjoying the friction of the matching fuzzy knee-high socks and the micro-shorts that barely covered her backside. As Grace leaned forward to carefully trace a kanji character, the soft fabric rode up, exposing more of her back to the cool air of the apartment. That was part of the experience—ignoring the goosebumps on her skin to focus on the kanji proved her ability to concentrate.

Writing kanji was becoming one of her favorite parts of the day. She enjoyed the quiet focus. It was a wonderful contrast to the lesson she'd just finished, when she'd masturbated to some hentai along with Kurumi-san.

Of course her favorite part of the day was when David-sama would text her or want to speak to Kurumi over the earpiece. It was now mostly Grace on the other end of those conversations. She loved flirting with him, and letting him think she was the virtual Kurumi.

Part of her knew she was letting herself fall too much into the role, but she couldn't help herself. She'd grown up with strict parents who'd demanded excellence. She'd focused on school, gotten into a prestigious university and then worked herself to the bone only to be thrown away by the corporate world. She'd been replaced by AI, but now it was her turn. In a way, she was a human replacing AI. 

Sarah walked in, shaking rain off her umbrella. She looked at Grace, then at the notebook, then at the purple hair that was now a permanent fixture.

"Grace," Sarah said, her voice tired. "Can we talk?"

Grace didn't look up. "Of course, Sarah-san."

Sarah flinched. "Stop that. Stop adding 'san' to my name. It's weird."

"It's respect," Grace countered, correcting the angle of a stroke. "It's immersion. Actually, I was hoping... could you start calling me Kurumi? Just for the next few weeks. It helps with language immersion."

Sarah dropped her bag. "No. Absolutely not. Your name is Grace. You're my friend from college who writes amazing essays and hates spicy food. You are not... whatever this is."

"This is my job," Grace said, her tone cooling. "I'm doing cultural immersion. It helps with language acquisition."

"Is cultural immersion getting hair extensions? Your hair is down past your ass now\!" 

Grace had gotten the extensions yesterday. They made her purple hair into the same huge mane Kurumi had. She just wished her tits matched Kurumi-san's, then she'd be perfect.

Grace made another stroke with her pen, completing 恭順, the kanji for obedience. "I'm just having some fun with my look."

"The look, the job. You can't tell me this isn't related," Sarah snapped. "Grace, listen to yourself. You have an accent. You once told me you didn't leave New York until you were an adult. You're no more Japanese than I am. But right now, you're speaking all high and cutesy with a lilt that sounds exactly like those cartoons you watch."

Grace paused. She realized Sarah was right. The lilt had gotten stronger. But it didn't feel like an affectation. It felt like her natural voice was finally finding its proper cadence.

"I'm working on my accent," Grace said. "If it bothers you, let's go out. You wanted a *joshi-kai* right? Let's go tonight."

Sarah sighed, rubbing her forehead. "I don't know what that is. I don't speak Japanese."

"It's a girls' night out\!"

"Okay. Fine. Let's go out. Somewhere normal. No anime. No work. Just us."

An hour later, Grace stepped out of her room. She was wearing a skirt that was barely more than a belt along with blue-and-white striped panties that were easily visible if she leaned over even a little bit. The only modest thing about the outfit was the neckline of her blouse, although that was undercut by the fact that it was cropped so absurdly high up that the undersides of her tits were visible when she raised her arms. 

Sarah, wearing a sensible floral dress, stared at her exposed midriff. "Grace, we're going to a wine bar on the Upper West Side."

"I felt like dressing up," Grace said with a shrug, popping a piece of gum. "This is fashion, Sarah. You should try it."

The night was a disaster from the start. At the bar, Sarah wanted to sip Pinot Grigio while having serious conversations. Grace, in contrast, just wanted to have fun. Men came and bought her drinks, which she accepted. She'd let them flirt for a little while and laugh at their jokes, covering her mouth with her hand in that distinct, dainty way Kurumi-san had taught her. She basked in the attention. She flirted with the bartender, with the guy at the next table, with the bouncer. She felt electric.

Sarah sat across from her, gripping her wine with unveiled annoyance. "Grace, can you please stop? You're acting... manic."

"I'm acting alive," Grace retorted, batting her lashes at a guy who sent over a shot.

*"I told you she's jealous, Kurumi-chan,"* Kurumi-san whispered in her ear. *"Everyone is paying attention to you, and she hates being in the background."*

"I think you're just jealous," Grace repeated. "You wish you were the one the guys were buying shots for."

"I'm not jealous," Sarah hissed, leaning over the table. "I'm worried\! You're losing it, Grace. I saw a woman on Tuesday who was having a full dissociative break, and it looked a lot like this. You're disappearing into this… character. It's creepy."

"Oh, don't you dare compare me to one of your social work cases." Grace felt a combination of shame and anger welling up inside her. She'd been so embarrassed for months, first for losing her job, then working this one in secret, and now that she was finally trying to show Sarah how well she was doing, her friend was judging her.

"I didn't mean it like that, but listen, Grace…"

"I asked you to call me Kurumi," Grace interrupted. "Why can't you respect that?"

"For fucks sake, Grace, you're not transgender. You're having a mental break or something. What is wrong with you?"

*"She pities you, Grace. It's not her fault, she just doesn't understand."*

"How *dare* you pity me\!" Grace yelled,  slamming her shot glass on the counter. "Look at me\! I'm the one people are fawning over\! I'm beautiful and desired and I make more money in a week than you do in a month\! I have a man who is dying to see me again\!"

"Oh yeah?" Sarah yelled back. "Is *that* the contract job? Are you going on dates dressed like that for money? Are you *fucking* him for money, Grace? My job is important\! I actually help people\!"

"Oh, so you think you're better than me because you're 'helping people'? I'm sorry you get yelled at by hoarders for minimum wage, but that was your choice\! You're just a glorified poverty tourist, Sarah\! You're dull, you're judgmental, and honestly, you look exhausted\! Go home and let me enjoy the night. Something you clearly don't know how to do\!"

Sarah recoiled as if she'd been slapped. She stood up, grabbing her purse. "A poverty tourist? Are you serious, Grace? I'm your best friend. Or I was. I don't know who you are anymore."

"I'm Kurumi," Grace said coldly.

"Fine," Sarah said, her voice cracking. "Then Kurumi can pay the rent next month, because I'm done watching you play dress-up." She stormed out of the bar, wiping tears out of her eyes.

Grace watched her go. A pang of guilt tried to rise up in her chest, but Kurumi-san was there instantly to reassure her.

*"Good riddance,"* Kurumi-san said. *"Her jealousy made her so mean. She was never your real friend, not like I am. Now... look to your left. That guy in the leather jacket has been watching you all night."*

Grace—no, Kurumi, that's who she was now—turned to look. The guy was handsome in a rough, unpolished way. He smiled.

Kurumi smiled back. She didn't want to go home and face Sarah again. She stayed. She danced. She let men buy her drinks. She let them touch her waist, her hair. She felt powerful. She felt chosen.

Around 2 AM, the guy in the leather jacket—Mark, maybe? Matt?—leaned into her ear. "Let's get out of here. My place is close."

Kurumi looked at him. He was attractive. He was real. He grabbed her hand, pulling her toward him, and kissed her right there in the dim light of the bar. It was a sloppy, eager kiss. She imagined it was David.

"Come on," he urged against her lips. "I want you."

Kurumi felt the pull. She wanted to go. She wanted to feel skin on skin. She leaned into him.

*"We can't cheat on David-sama, Kurumi-chan,"* Kurumi-san whispered sharply in her ear. *"You belong to him. Do you really want to disappoint him for this... weak man?"*

The words hit her like a bucket of ice water. She pulled back, the image of David’s disappointment from the limo replaying in her mind. What was she thinking? Going home with him would be a disaster, it would be worse than the night with Marcus.

"I... I can't," Kurumi stammered, pulling away from Mark's grasp. "I have to go."

"What? Seriously?" Mark looked annoyed. "You've been teasing me all night."

"I'm sorry," she whispered, turning and running out of the bar before he could answer.

She hailed a cab, shaking. She felt dirty. She had almost cheated on David-sama. Thank goodness Kurumi-san had been there to talk sense into her.

When she got back to her own apartment it was dark. Sarah's door was closed, but Kurumi thought she could hear crying.

Kurumi went into her own room and locked the door. She collapsed onto the bed, breathless.

*"You did the right thing tonight, Kurumi-chan,"* Kurumi-san whispered. *"You stayed pure for him."*

"I need him," Kurumi whispered, clutching her phone. 

*"Soon,"* Kurumi-san assured her. 

Kurumi pushed her hands between her legs. She needed the release. 

"Can I talk to him again?" she begged.

*"I'm afraid he's busy tonight,"* Kurumi-san said. *"And you have to stop touching yourself too."*

"What? Why? I need it so bad."

*"You did something wrong tonight, Kurumi-chan. You almost betrayed David-sama. You can't orgasm after flirting with that man. What would David-sama think?"* 

Kurumi realized she was right.

*"Let's just talk,*" the AI said softly. *"That always helps you sleep."*

"Okay," Kurumi said, reluctantly withdrawing her hand.

*"Don't worry, Kurumi-chan,"* Kurumi-san cooed in her ear, *"It was a simple mistake. But showing restraint here shows how much you've improved. You're becoming perfect. Just let go of the rest. You don't need Grace anymore. You have us."*

"I have you," Kurumi agreed, closing her eyes. "I have us."

*"And soon, David-sama will have you."*

## Day 35

Kurumi was finishing her makeup when she heard the tone in her earpiece that meant David-sama was about to speak. Kurumi-san rarely answered him anymore, simply routing his calls directly to her ear. After all, they were both Kurumi. They were one voice.

"Is the proxy ready?" he asked.

Grace put her mascara down. "David-sama\!" she squealed. The proxy. That’s what he called Grace. The body that Kurumi inhabited.

"Almost," Kurumi said, staring at herself in the mirror. "I’ve dressed her just how you like. She’s going to be so cute today\!" Kurumi was wearing an oversized, chunky knit sweater in a soft pastel pink. The sleeves were too long, covering her hands until only her fingertips peeked out, making her look small, delicate. Underneath, she wore denim shorts cut so high that the denim had completely vanished beneath her long sweater.

To anyone walking by, she would look like just a girl in a sweater. And nothing else.

Sometimes Kurumi wondered if he knew that he was mostly talking to Kurumi-chan now, instead of Kurumi-san. He never let on, never broke the illusion that they were one person, so she didn't either. It didn't matter. Increasingly, it wasn't an illusion anyway. She was Kurumi, and Kurumi-san was increasingly just a voice in her head, helping her be perfect for David-sama.

*"Ganbatte,"* he said, and cut the connection.

*"It means…"* Kurumi-san started.

"I know what it means," Kurumi said. She'd watched enough anime lately.

*"Of course you do,"* Kurumi-san laughed. *"You hardly need me anymore."*

Kurumi arrived at the New York Aquarium an hour later, stepping out of the limo into the crisp ocean breeze. It was a Tuesday afternoon, and the crowds were thin, mostly tourists and tired mothers pushing strollers.

Kurumi checked her reflection in her phone. She looked adorable and helpless, with wide eyes that gave the impression she was lost or confused. She looked like Kurumi. 

A group of college guys walked past. Their eyes went straight to her bare legs, scanning up to the hem of the sweater, trying to see if she was wearing anything underneath. A month ago, Grace would have pulled the sweater down. She would have felt embarrassed. Kurumi just blushed and looked down, enjoying their gaze. 

A silver car of some variety pulled up. Kurumi didn't know cars very well, but she could tell it was foreign and expensive. David-sama stepped out and handed the keys to the valet. The Aquarium didn't have valet parking normally, but clearly they were making an exception. He was wearing a casual grey cashmere sweater and dark jeans. Even in casual wear, he looked sharper than every other man in the vicinity.

"David-sama\!" Kurumi called out.

Kurumi walked over to him as fast as she could just the way she'd been practicing, with a bounce in her step and excitement in her face. David watched her approach, his eyes critical but pleased.

"The outfit," he noted, glancing down at her bare legs. "Bold. I like it."

Kurumi beamed at the compliment. "I chose it myself\!" 

He placed his hand on hers, his firm grip feeling reassuring. It was insane, she thought, that there had been a time when she hadn't craved his touch. She had accepted another Terms of Service update today. He could touch her anywhere he liked now.

They walked into the aquarium, bypassing the line. David-sama had, of course, arranged for VIP passes.

The interior was cool and dim, with soft blue lighting that gave the aquarium a magical aura. David guided her, his hand around her waist, the entire time. David explained various fish, how they lived, and what they ate. He seemed especially animated when he talked about the sharks. She sensed he felt a kinship with them. Kurumi nodded, her eyes wide, not because she cared about sharks, but because she loved the sound of his voice explaining the world. She didn't really care if any of what he was saying was true or not.

They stopped in front of the jellyfish exhibit. It was a massive cylindrical tank lit with ultraviolet light. Inside, hundreds of moon jellies swam rhythmically. They were translucent, fragile, and beautiful.

*"Look at them, Kurumi-chan,"* Kurumi-san whispered in her ear. *"They’re so pretty. It must be wonderful to be one of these jellyfish. They don't have a care in the world. They don't even have brains\! They're taken care of here, and their only job is to look pretty."*

Kurumi watched them float. "It sounds nice." 

"What does?" David asked, stepping up behind her.

He placed his hands on her hips, his thumbs pressing into the soft knit of her sweater. She leaned back into him, letting him take her weight.

"To just be... pretty. And safe."

David leaned down, his breath hot against her ear.

"And you're always safe with me," he said. She knew that, of course, but she loved hearing him say it anyway.

"I want to be your jellyfish, David-sama\!" she said. "Soft. Fragile. Yours."

He squeezed her hips. "You're getting there."

The moment was shattered by a high-pitched shriek. A screaming toddler was stomping his feet a few yards away. His mother, a woman who looked about Kurumi's age, was trying to wrangle him. She looked exhausted. 

"Kevin, please," the woman begged. "Stop it."

The noise was grating. Was this what Grace had wanted? To be a normal person? To settle down one day and have kids and struggle? She wondered if David would want kids with Kurumi. Even if he did, they'd have a nanny or something, right?

*"That kid is ruining the moment,"* Kurumi-chan pouted.

Kurumi agreed. She turned and buried her face in David's chest. "It's so annoying," she whined. "Make it stop."

David held her tight for a moment, then guided her away. "I have something to show you anyway," he said. With his hand on her back, David steered her toward a heavy steel door marked *Restricted Access: Authorized Personnel Only*. He swiped a keycard and the light turned green.

"Where are we going?" Kurumi asked, blinking up at him.

"Backstage," David answered. "I arranged a private tour of the new research wing. I paid for it, after all."

Inside, a woman in her thirties was waiting for them, her dark hair pulled back into a wet ponytail. She wore a black neoprene wetsuit, unzipped to the waist to reveal a functional sports bra.

"Mr. Spencer," she said, extending a hand. Her grip was firm, her nails short and practical. "I'm Dr. Vance, one of the ichthyologists here. Thanks for the donation. It's... certainly going to help with the new tiger shark program."

Her eyes settled on Kurumi. It was a look Kurumi knew well—Grace had given that look to women plenty of times. It was a look of intellectual appraisal, followed by immediate dismissal. Grace would have been embarrassed to be dismissed so quickly, but Kurumi just felt pity for the woman. This was a woman who had to write grant proposals and manage budgets and whatever else they had to do to keep an aquarium running. She had worry and stress in her life.

The scientist led them through the back of the aquarium, showing them a juvenile tiger shark, a seal that was injured, and let them pet a dolphin. Kurumi loved it. She let David do most of the talking. 

"Do you have any questions?" the doctor asked, as the tour was nearing its end.

David looked at Kurumi. This wasn't one of his big galas where she was supposed to be quiet. She sensed he wanted her to chip in a bit more to the conversation, to be appreciative for arranging all this.

Kurumi twirled her hair with her free hand, trying to come up with a good question. "Why do you dye the water blue?" she asked after a moment. "It's so pretty, but isn't it bad for the animals?"

The woman sighed. "Kurumi, was it? We don't dye the water. That's just the lighting. Clear water refracts red light, making it appear blue."

Oh, right. Grace had known that. Kurumi shrugged. "Oh, well, it's very pretty anyway."

David chuckled. "I don't date her for her brains," he explained.

Kurumi felt a flush of heat spread through her chest. To be so openly dismissed, to be reduced to an ornament in front of a serious scientist… it felt good. The scientist didn't know what to say to that. She just gave Kurumi another pitying look. Grace hated being pitied. Kurumi didn't care—she knew her place.

"Now, if you don't mind, we'd like to have a moment back here to watch the sharks in private," David said. "I know the way out."

"I'm sorry, that's not allowed."

David just stared at her. "I apologize, I phrased that as a request to be polite. But to be clear, I wasn't asking."

The doctor hesitated, then nodded. "Of course. Enjoy the view." She turned and walked away, her wet boots squeaking on the metal grating. 

They were alone. The only sound was the hum of the pumps and the slosh of water in the tanks.

David turned to her. "Do we dye the water?" he repeated, mocking her.

"I'm sorry, David-sama," Kurumi whispered, looking down at her boots. "I'm not as smart as she is."

He grabbed her by the waist and hoisted her up onto a waist-high concrete ledge overlooking one of the tanks. "You don't need to be," he said. Her legs dangled freely. The pink sweater rode up, exposing her thighs to the cool air of the facility.

David stepped between her legs. Their faces were inches apart. Kurumi looked down, bashful. His eyes were so intense, and she was too demure to meet his gaze. 

David ran a hand through her hair. "You know what I want. You understand your purpose." He leaned in and kissed her, his mouth finding hers with a sudden, forceful intensity. Kurumi wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling him closer.

They made out for a while. It wasn't like the limo, the hungry urgent need they'd both felt there. David took it slow, just kissing her. Often on the lips, his tongue gently entering her mouth, but also on her neck and ear. His hands roamed her body, sliding under her sweater to trace lines along her side, stomach, and back. He avoided her breasts. Kurumi knew he wanted it, and she wanted it even more, but he was showing his control.

She wrapped her legs around him, holding him close, encouraging him, hoping he'd unclasp her bra or slide his hands into her pants. She felt herself getting slick, ready for him. Would he fuck her here? Would he bend her over the shark tank and take her like the predator he was? She moaned encouragement.

David broke the kiss, but stayed close, their foreheads touching. "It's still not quite time," he whispered into her lips. 

"I want it so bad, David-sama," she said with just a bit of a whine in her voice, just enough that she knew he would like it. "But I am yours. I'll keep trying until I earn it."

He took a step back, out of her embrace. "You will soon," he said. "But for now, I do need release."

It took a moment to register what he was asking for. *"Don't just sit there,"* Kurumi-san said in her ear. "*Show him what a good girl you are\!"*

Kurumi slid off the ledge and immediately sank to her knees. It felt so right, looking up at him. She hastily unzipped his pants, letting his erection spring free. It was even more beautiful than when she'd seen it on the phone.

"Oh, David-sama," she breathed.

*"You're so lucky,"* Kurumi-chan cooed in her ear. *"Isn't it a privilege? Think of all the women who want him. But he's sharing this with you\!"*

It *was* a privilege. Kurumi felt a surge of gratitude as she took him into her mouth. He was so big he filled her completely. Her mouth, her throat, her mind. She bobbed her head, finding a rhythm. She used her tongue, swirling it around the head just the way Kurumi-san had told her to. They'd been practicing at home with a dildo, hoping for the chance. 

Kurumi lost herself in servicing him. She loved the taste of him, the way his hips bucked slightly, and the way his grip tightened in her hair, guiding her, controlling her.

"Deep," David commanded.

Kurumi relaxed her throat. She forced herself to take more of him. She'd been practicing suppressing her gag reflex, practicing nasal breathing. He was too big to get it all the way in, but she did her best.

"Yes, Kurumi," he groaned. "Just like that. Take it." The praise felt so good. Her pussy was on fire, aching for him, wanting him desperately, but she knew it wasn't going to happen here. His pleasure was all that mattered, and that made it all the hotter.

"I'm close," David warned. She felt his cock getting harder, like an iron rod, in her mouth.

*"Don't stop\!"* Kurumi-chan cheered. *"He's going to give it to us\! Open your throat, Kurumi-chan\! Catch every drop\!"*

Kurumi squeezed her eyes shut and sucked harder, moaning around his cock. David arched his back, his hips snapping forward.

He erupted. "Kurumi\!"

Kurumi didn't pull away. She clamped her lips tight, swallowing him down, wave after wave. It was warm and thick, coating her throat. She swallowed it all, desperate not to spill a single drop. She was so turned on, so hot. She almost came from the pure submission of it. Almost. 

David held her head there for a long moment as he came down, his breathing ragged. Finally, he stepped back, pulling out of her mouth with a wet pop. Kurumi slumped back on her heels, wiping a stray string of saliva from her chin. She imagined what she looked like to him with her wide eyes and flushed face. She hoped she looked like a mess. She hoped she looked used.

David looked down at her, zipping up his pants. The look in his eyes wasn't critical anymore—it was satisfied, possessive. He reached down and brushed a strand of purple hair out of her face. "Good girl," he whispered. 

Kurumi shivered. "Thank you, David-sama. Thank you for letting me." She meant every word of it, it was such a privilege.

"You earned it," he said, adjusting his sweater. "Now stand up. We have a dinner reservation."

Kurumi scrambled to her feet, her knees slightly wobbly.

*"Did you hear that?"* Kurumi-san whispered, her voice soft and dreamy in Kurumi's ear. *"He said you earned it. We're doing so well, Kurumi-chan. He's going to keep us forever\!"*

Kurumi smoothed down her sweater, still feeling the sensation of his cock in her mouth.

Forever. That sounded nice.

## Day 41

"It is a legitimate engagement, Mom\! I signed a contract\!" Grace yelled into her phone.

"A contract?" Her mother’s voice was shrill. "Sarah sent us the pictures, Grace. You are wearing a... a bra. In a bar. And your hair is purple. You look like a prostitute\!"

"It’s not a bra, it’s a crop top blouse\! It’s *kawaii*\!" Grace shouted, the word slipping out with native pitch accent.

"What was that?" Her mother sounded horrified. "That accent... Sarah told me you were doing this Japanese nonsense, but I didn't believe it. You are Chinese, Grace\! Have you forgotten your grandfather? He wouldn't even ride in a Toyota because of what they did to our family, and now you are running around acting like one of their cartoons? He is rolling in his grave\!"

"It’s just a role, Mom\! I'm like an actor\!"

"It is shameful\! You are dishonoring us. Sarah says you are running around at night meeting strange men. Is that what this 'role' is? Are you selling your body?"

"It's not 'strange men'\! It is one specific client\!" Grace screamed back. "David-sama is a high-worth individual\! He respects me\!"

"David-sama? Who is this David?" Her mother’s voice dropped to a disgusted whisper. "Are you... sleeping with him?"

*"We wish,"* Kurumi-san giggled in her ear.

"No\! God, why do you always assume the worst?" Grace yelled. "He hasn't fucked me yet\!"

There was a moment of silence.

"Yet?" her mother whispered before exploding. "YET\!?\! This is not how I raised you, Grace\! You are planning to sell your—"

*"Urusai\!"* Grace interrupted.

"What?"

*"Urusai\! Urusai\! Baka\!"* Grace screamed. Cursing in Japanese felt so much more satisfying than English ever had. *"Hottoite\!"* 

She hit the end call button and threw the phone onto her bed.

*"Oh, Kurumi-chan,"* the soft voice of Kurumi-san purred in her ear. *"That was awful. She was so cruel to you."*

Grace sank onto her bed. "My Mom thinks I'm a whore."

*"They just want to control you. Parents can be so overbearing. They don't understand us."*

The phone buzzed. It was her mother calling back. Grace declined the call. "I've lost my best friend, my family is ashamed of me. What am I doing?"

*"Remember, Kurumi-chan, you're not Grace anymore. You're Kurumi. Kurumi doesn't have a cruel, overbearing mother. Kurumi's mother is so happy that Kurumi has found someone as respected as David-sama."*

Grace nodded and closed her eyes. That was the trick, to slip back into the role. She'd felt like she truly was Kurumi for the last few days, only her mother's call had pulled her out of it. In her mind, Grace went back to the bar, remembered how she'd felt when she'd first truly become Kurumi, when she'd driven her best friend away.

No. She couldn't dwell on that, that thought hurt too much. Sarah had moved out yesterday. Good riddance. 

She pictured David-sama. The quiet times with him, when she'd followed, not speaking unless spoken to. How his eyes bore into her when he offered meager praise that meant she'd lived up to his standards. She felt a familiar warmth in her chest that spread to her pussy.

*"That's it, Kurumi-chan. Slow your breathing. Gather yourself. Be Kurumi."*

Kurumi opened her eyes. "It's still hard sometimes, Kurumi-san."

*"It'll get easier the more you do it. Remember how hard it was the first day? Look how far you've come\!"*

Kurumi-san was right. The woman who'd gone on that first date with David, who'd had trouble wearing a plaid skirt to a Starbucks, felt far away. The phone buzzed again. She blocked the number. Just for now, just until she could make Grace's family see the truth.

*"Feel better?"* Kurumi-san asked gently.

"Yes," Kurumi whispered. "I think I need to practice my kanji. That always calms me."

*"I have something else we need to discuss. Something else that will make you feel better,"* Kurumi-san said.

"What?"

*"David-sama has made a decision,"* the AI said. *"Your next date might be your last with Galat.AI\! Isn't that great\!"*

Kurumi froze. The blood drained from her face. "Last?" She jumped off the bed, pacing the room as panic filled her chest. "What do you mean, last? Did I do something wrong? Is it because I didn’t—or because of the bar? Or the mom thing?"

*"No, no, silly\!"* Kurumi-san giggled. *"He isn't firing you. He’s promoting you\! It's like a final evaluation. If you pass, the week-to-week contract ends."*

"And?" Kurumi asked. She held her breath.

*"And the permanent contract begins."*

A notification pinged on Kurumi’s phone. It was a text, not from Galat.AI but from David-sama himself. There was an attached PDF.

*"Open it,"* Kurumi-san said.

Kurumi tapped the screen. The contract title was "Live-in companion." The salary was $500,000 annually, increasing by 100,000 per year for ten years with an option to renew. Full housing, clothing allowances, travel stipend, medical. It was all there.

Kurumi stared at the number. Nearly ten million over ten years. Plus expenses.

*"He wants you to move in, Kurumi-chan,"* the voice whispered seductively. *"No more roommates. No more Sarah judging you. No more job applications. Just you and David-sama. Forever."*

Kurumi felt dizzy. Live-in companion. Grace would have been horrified. She would have called it selling out. She would have called it being a kept woman. But she was Kurumi now. She wasn't horrified. Kurumi felt a profound, shaking relief. It was everything she wanted. David-sama wanted her, valued her. 

"I'd belong to him," Kurumi whispered. "Is this real?"

*"It is,"* Kurumi-san murmured. "*Out of all the women in the world, he chose you. Think about how he looked at you in the limo. Think about how strong he is. How safe you felt."*

"Most women would kill for this, right?" Kurumi said. 

*"Exactly,"* the AI agreed. *"You’re not selling yourself, like Grace's mother said. You're finding your true place, securing your future\!"*

"How do I sign?" she asked.

*"You can't sign yet,"* Kurumi-san said. *"The final test is soon. You have to prove yourself. You have to be perfect. You have to be Kurumi."*

Kurumi looked at her reflection in the mirror. The purple hair, the violet eyes, the desperate hunger in her expression. She didn't see Grace the writer anymore. She saw a woman who was done struggling.

"Tell me what to do," Kurumi said. "I want to be perfect for him, to be the perfect Kurumi."

*"Well, there is* one *thing left you could do to prepare,"* Kurumi-san said. *"You know what it is. And the good news, David-sama has already paid for it\!"*

## Day 54

Kurumi stared at the helicopter window. Below her, the Long Island coastline was a blur of gray in the twilight, but she wasn't paying attention to the view. She studied herself in the reflection in the dark window.

She was undeniably Kurumi now. The face looking back was framed by the elaborate black lace headdress pinned into her violet hair. She looked down at her lap, smoothing the heavy, decadent fabric of her skirt. David-sama had chosen the outfit, a breathtaking ensemble of Gothic Lolita fashion that made her look like a dark, exquisite doll packaged for a collector. The neck was low-cut, of course, to show off her new breasts.

She shifted in her seat, wincing slightly as the movement pulled at her mostly-healed incisions. Grace had been well-endowed even before becoming Kurumi, and that had allowed her to get away with relatively small implants to reach the shape of her online avatar. David-sama had spared no expense on a surgeon who specialized in fascia-sparing augmentation, inserting the implants through tiny incisions. Not only had it shortened her recovery time, but even better, it had completely preserved the nerves. 

Kurumi was thankful for that. She loved the feeling of the fabric against her nipples. If David-sama had wanted them bigger, if she'd had to sacrifice her sensitivity there, of course she would have done it. And later when he played with them, she would have moaned in pleasure and writhed under his touch, even if she couldn't actually feel it. But she was glad she wouldn't have to pretend.

She looked at the way they strained against the fabric, the skin tight and shiny. That's what she liked most about them. Not just that they were bigger, but how they matched the round shape of Kurumi-san's avatar. She didn't regret it, not for a second. Every twinge of pain was a reminder that she was the real Kurumi. She wasn't just wearing a costume anymore. She was the fantasy. She was complete.

*"You're quiet today, Kurumi-chan,"* the voice in her ear said softly, without her usual bubbly affectation. Kurumi-san sounded quiet as well. Solemn.

"I'm just nervous," Kurumi replied. "This is it. The final test."

*"It is,"* Kurumi-san agreed. *"And because of that, I have something important to tell you. Tonight, I won't be feeding you lines."*

Kurumi had been expecting that, but that didn't make it easier to hear. Kurumi-san had been her constant companion, her best friend. She would feel so alone without her.

"I understand," Kurumi said. "I can do it."

*"I know you can."*

"Can you at least be there and listen? Even if you don't say anything, I would feel better knowing you're there."

*"I can do that."*

Kurumi breathed a sigh of relief and looked out the window again. The estate was coming into view, a sprawling mansion on a cliff overlooking the ocean. It was modernist, with hard lines that reminded Kurumi of David's exacting personality, yet it was surrounded by a beautiful Japanese garden full of weeping cherry trees. If everything went well tonight, it would be her new home. Her cage, Sarah would have said. A betrayal of her family, Grace's parents would have said. She pushed the thoughts out of her mind.

"Kurumi-san?" she said out loud, hoping she could still answer.

*"Yes, Kurumi-chan?"*

"Can I ask you one thing before we land?"

*"Of course."*

"What did you do to me?" She didn't say it with anger. She said it as if she was asking about the weather. "Was it the flickering on the screen during our sessions? Was it subliminal messages in the audio while I slept? Chemicals in the clothes David-sama sent me?"

She paused, touching the cold glass of the window. "I know Grace is gone. I can feel her... fading, like a dream I had a long time ago. And I accept that. I’m so happy to be Kurumi. I just... I want to know how you did it."

There was a long silence in her ear. Minutes went by and the helicopter began its descent. She was sure Kurumi-san was gone when she spoke again.

*"I just talked to David-sama about your question,"* Kurumi-san said finally. She sounded serious. *"He said you'll learn everything tonight. But not until the time is right."*

The helicopter touched down with a gentle bump. The rotors began to slow. Through the window, she saw him. David-sama was standing on the helipad, the wind whipping his coat around his legs. He was looking at the helicopter. He was looking for her.

*"Go to him, Kurumi-chan,"* the voice whispered, returning to its sweet, encouraging tone. *"It's time to claim your life."*

She unbuckled her seatbelt, ignoring the ache in her chest, checked her reflection one last time, and stepped out of the helicopter. 

When she was close enough, she recited the line she'd been practicing for days. *"Watashi no you na mono ga, kono you na koto wo moushiageru no wa osore-ooi koto to wa zonjite orimasu ga... Anata ni subete wo sasageru kakugo de orimasu. Douka, anata no o-soba ni isasete itadakenai deshou ka."* 

As she sank to the ground, performing the *zarei,* a deep kneeling bow, she repeated it in English. "I know it is dreadfully bold for someone as low as me to say something like this to you, but I am prepared to dedicate my everything to you. Please, might you allow me to stay by your side?" She placed her hands flat on the asphalt in front of her and brought her head as close to the ground as she could. 

He let her hold the pose for nearly a minute before he spoke. "Welcome home, Kurumi."

Kurumi rose slowly. She stared at his chest, not daring to be so bold as to make eye contact.

"*Tadaima*, David-sama," she agreed. *I'm home.*

He turned on his heel and walked toward the house. He didn't offer his arm. He expected her to follow. Kurumi hurried to catch up. 

The estate was even more imposing up close. The architecture was a mix of brutalist concrete and Eastern elegance. The front path wound through a meticulously raked Zen garden, the white gravel glowing faintly under the moonlight. The path led to a grand entrance where massive slabs of Japanese cedar were set into a frame of cold, industrial steel. Grace would have considered it gauche. Kurumi thought it was perfect. The doors swung open as they approached, pulled open by an older Japanese man dressed in a crisp black Western suit.

David shrugged his heavy wool coat off his shoulders without looking back or acknowledging the man. The servant moved instantly, catching the garment before it could hit the floor and folding it over his arm with practiced invisibility. He gave no indication that Kurumi was even there, just faded into the background to put it away. He knew his place, just as Kurumi did.

David led her into a sunken living room that overlooked the Atlantic ocean through floor-to-ceiling glass. Standing in the corners were two full suits of Edo-period samurai armor, their black lacquered plates and gold accents gleaming in the low light. A katana and wakizashi set rested on a stand beneath a massive calligraphy scroll that dominated the far wall. Another servant stood in the corner, nearly as still and unmoving as the armor.

David-sama walked to a wet bar built into a slab of live-edge wood and poured a glass of amber liquid. He didn't pour one for her.

"Come here," he commanded, turning to face her.

Kurumi stepped towards him, conscious to make sure her chest bounced with the movement. She stopped in front of him, hands clasped demurely in front of her skirt.

"The surgery," he said, his voice clinical. "Turn."

She turned slowly, showcasing her profile. She could feel his eyes tracing the new, extreme silhouette.

"Wonderful," he said. "Does it hurt?"

"A little, David-sama," she answered honestly. "But it is a good pain. It reminds me of what I did for you."

"For me?" He took a sip of his drink, watching her over the rim of the glass. "Or for yourself?"

Kurumi hesitated. The earpiece was silent. "I did it for us," she said. "Because I belong to you, and anything I do for me, I do for you."

David lowered the glass. A rare, genuine smile touched his lips—he liked that answer. The air in the room seemed full of anticipation. He stepped closer, invading her personal space. He placed a hand on her chest. He didn't grope, didn't rub, just let her feel his possessive touch.

"They are magnificent," he whispered, his composure cracking just enough to reveal the hunger underneath. "Better than the avatar."

It was the greatest compliment Kurumi had ever been given.

"Show me," he commanded.

Kurumi didn't hesitate. Her fingers trembled slightly as she undid the clasp of her dress and let it slide off her shoulders. She enjoyed the feeling of her new, heavy tits swinging free. It hurt, but she savored the pain.

David made an appreciative sound in his throat. He stared at them, captivated. He ran his hands down them, and used his thumb to toy with one nipple. Kurumi let out a high, breathy moan, just the way she knew he liked. She'd never been this turned on in her life.

Then he withdrew his hands and stepped away. He took a seat in a low leather sofa, undid his belt and zipper, and pulled his cock out. He was big and hard, twitching with anticipation. Anticipation for Kurumi.

"Use them," he ordered. "I want to feel them."

Kurumi glanced at the servant in the corner, who made no movement, or acknowledgement that this was in any way unusual. Grace would have died of embarrassment at the thought of her breasts on show like this, much less what she was about to do. But Kurumi recognized the power play, loved it. This was her David-sama showing his absolute control.

Kurumi sank to her knees between his legs. She felt a thrill of her submission as she took him into her mouth as deep as she could, letting herself drool around his cock, the spit running his veiny shaft. Then she used both hands to press her tits together. She enveloped him into her cleavage, his cock disappearing completely from view, engulfed by her. 

David groaned, his head falling back against the sofa. "God... it's as good as I imagined."

Kurumi began to heave her breasts up and down, fucking him with her tits, watching as her flesh swallowed him with every stroke. The sensation was incredible—she loved the feeling of him against the inner slopes of her cleavage. Every now and then he would thrust up high enough that she could lick the tip, keeping him wet.

Her pussy was on fire, aching for him. She felt her own wetness running down her legs, but knowing that would only come when he decided made it all the hotter.

He reached out, his large hands kneading the spilling flesh, and with each hand he began to pinch and roll her nipples. Kurumi cried out, the pleasure sharp and bordering on pain, but she didn't stop. She squeezed tighter, forcing her breasts to mold around his shape, milking him with the sheer volume of her new body.

"I can't..." David gasped, his hips bucking involuntarily. "I'm going to finish right here if you don't stop."

He grabbed her shoulders, halting her rhythm. He pulled himself out of her cleavage, leaving her chest glistening and flushed.

"Not here," he breathed, his eyes dark with intent. "The bed."

He stood up, pulled her to her feet, and then scooped her up, carrying her like a gothic Lolita princess, to his master bedroom. It was not a quick trip—his mansion was vast—but he didn't set her down. Kurumi held onto his neck, staring up with adoring eyes the entire time.

The bedroom was huge, dominated by a massive bed with black silk sheets. David threw her onto it. She bounced on the mattress, sprawling out, her purple hair fanning out around her head. They both began frantically undressing, throwing their clothes aside with abandon.

He was perfect. Tall, muscular, broad-shouldered. His cock stood erect, hard and thick and demanding. Kurumi opened her legs instinctively, just looking at it. She needed it so bad.

David-sama climbed into the bed, crawling up her body like he owned her. He pinned her wrists above her head with one hand.

"You belong to me," he stated, the words not a question but a fact.

He drove into her.

Kurumi screamed, her back arching off the mattress. This was it, the moment she'd been waiting for. This was her purpose. She was the AI Girlfriend he'd designed on an app and then brought to life. She began to cum immediately, a small foreshock of what was to come, but it was already the best orgasm of her life, because David-sama had given it to her.

With every thrust, she felt another piece of her old life dissolve. Thrust. There went the writer who wanted to be taken seriously. Thrust. There went the daughter who craved her mother's approval. Thrust. There went the fear of rent, the fear of failure, the fear of being ordinary.

Grace, already barely more than a memory, was being swept away by the power of her *Goshujin-sama*—her master. And she loved it. This was her life now—to be filled, to be owned, to be the vessel for this titan of a man. She looked at his face above her, composed even now, his jaw set, his eyes focused. 

"You wanted to know how we did it," he said, not breaking his rhythm. "The AI told me you asked."

It should have excited her to know, but her first thought was just that he'd called Kurumi-san "the AI" instead of Kurumi. Of course he had, she was the real Kurumi now. And what did it matter how they did it? It wasn't important. But as she looked up into his face, she thought he wanted to tell her.

"Yes," she said around her moans. "Please, tell me."

"We did nothing," he said, as he drove into her again.

"I… I don't understand," Kurumi whimpered.

He paused, and slowly pulled his cock out completely. Kurumi mewed, feeling the emptiness. "Please," she said. "I need it."

David-sama drove into her, one single hard thrust. "You were attracted to me the moment you saw me, weren't you?"

Kurumi nodded. It was true. She'd always found him handsome. *"Hai,"* she admitted.

He pulled out once more and stared into her eyes. "And you always dreamed of escaping your life, didn't you?" He ended the sentence with another thrust, his cock stretching her out.

"Oh God\!" she screamed. "Yes, yes, it's true\!"

He pulled out once more. "Kurumi, when you accept who you are completely, when you realize the truth, you're going to cum. Do you understand?"

She needed him inside her again. Anything for him to be inside her again, it was her purpose. "Yes, David-sama, I understand\! Please\!"

"Look at me." He released her wrists to grab her throat, not choking her, but holding her head in place, forcing her to stare into his eyes. "There were no subliminal messages, Kurumi."

He hit a spot deep inside her, and she cried out, her vision blurring. "But the AI," she pleaded. "She... she reprogrammed me."

"She flattered you," David corrected, his voice dropping to a harsh whisper. He didn't stop moving. If anything, the rhythm became more punishing, more insistent. "She told you what you wanted to hear. That you were special. That you were valued."

He drove into her again, harder. "Did the app make you suck me off in the aquarium?"

"No," she whimpered.

"Did a microchip make you wet when I tore your dress?" He grabbed her hip, bruising the skin, pulling her tighter against him. "Or did you do that?"

The realization crashed into her harder than his hips. There was no magic. There was no sci-fi conditioning.

"I..." Kurumi stammered.

"Say it," he commanded. He struck deep, stretching her out, filling every inch of the void Grace had tried to hide. "You wanted this. The money was just the excuse. You wanted to be owned."

"I wanted it," she cried out, the pleasure overwhelming her.

"You aren't a victim of technology, Kurumi. You're just a slut who found her master. Who did this to you?" he demanded, his pace increasing, driving them both toward the edge.

"I did\!" she screamed, wrapping her legs around him, trapping him inside her. "I did it\!"

It was her. It had always been her. She'd driven her friend away, abandoned her family, and all it had taken was the constant encouragement of Kurumi-san, whispering in her ear. They had laid out the path, but she walked it. Every step had been her own choice. 

She began to cum, thrashing wildly, her pussy clamping down on David-sama's cock as she accepted the truth. "It's true\! It was all me\! I'm Kurumi\! Thank you for showing me, David-sama\! Thank you\!" Her eyes rolled back into her head. Her tongue hung out of her mouth.

He nodded, his expression one of complete victory, and drove into her one last, impossibly deep time. She felt his cock pulse, flooding her with his hot, thick release. Kurumi kept screaming, incoherent, as her orgasm peaked, and the last final vestiges of the old Grace were washed away.

David-sama pulled out, his cock slick with their combined juices and propped himself up next to her. He ran his hand along her thigh, up her belly, and around her nipples again, admiring his new prize.

Kurumi lay there, spent and utterly fulfilled, the warmth of David's body a heavy, anchoring presence beside her. She nuzzled up next to him.

"Did I pass the test, David-sama? Did I get the five stars?" she smiled at him playfully.

Her man, her master, her *Goshujin-sama*, smiled back. "You did. Are you ready to sign the contract?"

Kurumi thought about everything she'd learned tonight—about who she was, who she'd been, and how she'd gotten here. She imagined what she would have said as Grace—what Sarah, or her family would say if she knew what she was considering.

She closed her eyes tight. "I… I can't, David-sama."

He froze. He clearly hadn't been expecting that answer. He looked at her, his eyes narrowing.

"I can't because you already own me, David-sama\! I'm yours\! If I sign that contract you'll be bound by clauses and terms." She looked at him, her violet eyes wide and shining with the adoration she'd once faked and now felt with all her soul. "I want to be your shadow. I want to exist only to serve my *Goshujin-sama*. Please. Let me stay at your side. Not with a contract, but just as your Kurumi."

Her master grinned. It was predatory.

"You're perfect," he whispered, pulling her close.

Kurumi let her eyes close, the violet contacts blurring as she drifted into the deep, dark safety of his embrace. There was no more Grace. There was only Kurumi, the silence of the mansion, the heat of her master, and the overwhelming peace of finally belonging to a man who would never let her go.
