<h2 id="part-1-you-ve-been-selected">Part 1: You’ve Been Selected!</h2>
<p>The glow of the computer screen bathed Candice in a gray light. It was well past midnight, and Richard was sound asleep in the bedroom. She could hear him snoring. It had been another uneventful evening. They’d watched some TV, had a frozen pizza dinner, and fallen asleep. And, Candice considered, that was sort of the problem. Candice was 29 years old — still in the prime of her life! She and Richard were a young couple. The magic couldn’t be gone already, could it?  </p>
<p>Richard had been a bit more distant lately, spending more and more time on his phone. That in itself wasn’t too bad, but she had seen him quickly lock the screen lately as she’d walked by, and she’d begun to get… not suspicious, exactly. More scared. Scared that she was going to lose him to some sort of online affair.   </p>
<p>So here she was at two in the morning, sitting in the dark office browsing this strangely monochromatic erotic story website. Candice knew a thing or two about computers — she was actually a software engineer by trade — so it had been easy to start tracking his phone use. That had led her here.  </p>
<p>It seemed Richard had read a lot of the stories on this website. He seemed to really like the ones that involved viruses that turned women into mindless bimbos and another series called Master PC, where the protagonist had a computer program that let you change people. They were kind of a “genie grants wishes” type of story wrapped up in a modern technological shell. Candice thought it was a kind of lazy plot device. Computer programs couldn’t do that. At least hypnosis had some grounding in reality.  </p>
<p>But she was curious about what Richard saw in them. Apparently he had a thing for mind control and submission that she’d never known about before. What else didn’t she know? She typed “Master PC” into her search bar to find more stories. Only one search result came up.</p>
<p>&gt;You’ve Been Selected. Install Master PC!\&lt;</p>
<p>Weird. She clicked the link to see what the site was about, and immediately a program unpacked onto her computer. Even weirder. Clicking links from search engines was not supposed to do that. It hadn’t even put her through an install wizard.   </p>
<p>An icon now sat on her desktop. The graphic was a simple stylized M. Master PC. She knew she shouldn’t click it. It could be a virus, spyware, or who knows what. But she was just too curious. She had to.  </p>
<p>The program launched and there it was, just like in all the stories. Candice saw herself from a third person view, as if a camera was about three feet to her right. Which, incidentally, would put it inside the wall. Beside her picture were her vitals. 5‘3” and 163 pounds. Long brown hair in a conservative haircut, though it was pretty messy this time of the night. There was an “athletics” entry that was at 40%, whatever that meant. Hovering over it revealed a multitude of sub-categories, from endurance to dexterity. Her sexuality was listed as well, as its own top-level statistic. It was only 30%. Hovering the cursor over that number revealed even more subcategories, from nipple sensitivity to the “Erogenous Shoulder Slider.” There were more statistics, but she skipped them.  </p>
<p>As she looked closer, it wasn’t exactly like all the stories. Admittedly, Master PC was always a little bit different depending on who was writing, but the characters in the stories always seemed to have the ability to type whatever they wanted in. Candice looked all around for a box where she could type “Candice looks like a young Heidi Klum, but prettier and wins the lottery every time she plays.” This box was nowhere to be found.  </p>
<p>In its place were a dizzying array of drop-down menus, sliders, and text boxes filled with numbers and percentages. A window called “Mental State” flashed an ever-changing array of icons that made no sense to Candice, even though she already knew what she was thinking. Candice browsed a bit until she found the “superficial appearance” tab. That seemed like a safe place to experiment. She adjusted the “master weight” slider down thirty pounds, and watched them drop off the on-screen avatar. She hovered the mouse over “Apply Changes,” held her breath, and clicked.  </p>
<p>A shiver ran over her body, and instantly she felt lighter. Candice had been heavier and lighter over the years as she’d dieted, achieved her goals, and then gotten lazy and fallen off the wagon. One thing she’d never noticed was the difference she felt as she slowly packed on or lost weight, but now Candice immediately felt better as the pounds evaporated. She sat in shock, staring at the screen, at herself, and back again. It was real. My God, it was real.  </p>
<p>What should she do? Should she go wake up Richard? Should she just delete the program and forget about it? Should she call the news? She stared at the screen for five minutes, before realizing there was really only one choice. Anyone given this kind of power would have to use it. It was just too tempting… and she could show Richard later, once she had figured out how it worked. She made more adjustments. She was happy with her breasts, but they’d begun to sag just a bit. Richard had said it was just her imagination when she’d mentioned it to him, but she could tell. It couldn’t hurt to make them perkier, so she found that dial under the “breasts” subcategory and adjusted it up to where she’d been in high school… maybe even a bit better. She found the “apparent age” slider, and adjusted it down to 21. A warning flashed, saying she should be careful when using the “apparent age” slider in conjunction with the “biological age” slider. She made a mental note to find that option later.  </p>
<p>Then she really got into it, shaping her eyebrows, lengthening her eyelashes, slightly plumping her lips, and making her nails longer and stronger. She made her hair a darker chocolate brown and gave it the lustrous sheen that only models on the boxes of hair-care products have. Then she took some more weight off just for fun. There was another slider for “facial symmetry.” She moved that down, and her features distorted grotesquely. Then she slid it up to 100%. Her features returned to normal. In fact, better than normal. She couldn’t tell exactly what was different about her face… but it was just overall more attractive.  </p>
<p>In the end, the avatar in front of her was like a much, much prettier version of herself. It was still herself, still Candice, but a version of herself that had just spent hours at an all-inclusive spa and was having a great make-up and hair day. She hit “Apply” and ran over to the mirror. A gorgeous woman stared back at her.  </p>
<p>Going back to the computer, she typed Richard’s name and began browsing his vitals. Again, jumping to “Superficial Appearance,” she brought his weight down a bit. He wasn’t as far off his college weight as Candice, but he had gained a bit. She turned it down just enough that she didn’t think he’d notice and upped his “facial symmetry,” which did wonders for him as well in ways she couldn’t quite pinpoint. She stopped there, not wanting to do anything too drastic that he’d notice. She clicked “Apply.”  </p>
<p>Taking a breath, she realized she was doing exactly what all the characters in the Master PC stories always did. She chided herself. With this kind of power, you needed to use it on more important things than breast perkiness. She went into Richard’s health tab. He always complained about his back. Numbers representing muscle strength and resilience, bone density and white cell production… it was all there. And a lot more complicated than “superficial appearance.” Candice got the impression she’d need to be a doctor to really comprehend most of it. Nevertheless, she managed to make some tweaks that she thought would help.   </p>
<p>And if she could do something like that.... what about her grandparents? They were in pretty poor health. Could she make them healthier? Make them in better shape and more mobile for the rest of their lives? Make them younger altogether? What about people she didn’t know? Should she be curing kids with cancer? Something else from the Master PC stories surfaced in her mind. Some of them talked about a sort of “shadow police,” making sure people like Candice didn’t cause problems. They were just stories… but obviously she wasn’t the only person with Master PC. And she hadn’t heard of any cancer wards suddenly being completely cured. She’d have to take this slow. Think about it. Still, she pulled up her grandparents’ and dialed their biological age (she’d found that setting on the health tab) back three years. There. Now, she had some time to figure out exactly what to do for them. She resolved to come back to the Big Questions later. For now, she was going to do some safe stuff no one would notice.  </p>
<p>The “mental” tab caught her eye. She pulled Richard back up, and with a voyeuristic thrill checked him out. Under Romantic Love, there was a drop-down box. Candice’s name, along with a few other women, were listed there. Most of them were his ex-girlfriends. She was shocked, until she began browsing through it. For some reason, it rated love on a scale of 1 to 512. His love for her was in the mid 400s. No other woman got out of the 30s. She thought about turning herself up all the way to 512, but resisted. She knew she’d regret making him love her on anything but his own terms. But under Sexual Attraction, she was nearly heartbroken to find that she rated lower than several of those same ex-girlfriends. Was this the source of his distance? Candice had never considered sex to be the main component of a relationship, but she’d always heard guys were different that way.  </p>
<p>In the next room, she heard the shower turn off. She hadn’t even realized it had been turned on. She looked at the time. Richard was up and getting ready for work! Panic struck her. She slammed the laptop shut and wondered if he’d notice the changes. Would they be too much to explain away? She jumped into bed, pulling the covers over her.  </p>
<p>Richard stepped out of the shower. “Hey, hon. Back in bed?”  </p>
<p>“Yeah.... I’m not feeling good. I’m going to call into work,” she replied, her face muffled in the pillow.  </p>
<p>“Anything I can do? Want me to grab some medicine or something?”  </p>
<p>“No, I was just up taking some Tylenol when you got in the shower.”  </p>
<p>They made a bit more small talk before Richard left, Candice being careful to hide her body under the covers. Richard left for work, and Candice called in sick, then immediately jumped back onto the computer.  </p>
<p>She pulled up her own profile. She looked back at the bar labeled “30% sexual”. She hadn’t made any psychological changes to herself yet, and this seemed like a good place to experiment. Besides, it would probably make their relationship stronger. She turned it up to 80% and clicked “Apply.” She felt the same shiver, and immediately, thinking back on Richard, she realized she should have done this before he left so they could have had a morning quickie before he left… and then she smiled. It worked! But she didn’t feel like a sexual zombie. She just felt more, well, sexual. And she enjoyed sex as much as the next person. More couldn’t really be bad, right?  </p>
<p>She decided she’d made enough changes for now. She got up, got a shower, and pulled on some clothes. They were a bit too big for her new, more slender frame. She hadn’t been this thin since high school. Maybe not even then.</p>
<p>Candice looked and felt better than she had in years, and it made her want to get out of the apartment. Part of her also felt like she was in some kind of fever dream. Like having Master PC couldn’t possibly be real. Somehow, getting out into the world felt like it would prove something to herself. Would guys be checking her out again, like they had when she was younger? She had to know. </p>
<p>Candice grabbed her purse and headed out to the mall. It was deserted, like all malls were these days. She started to go into Lane Bryant, but something stopped her. Across the way was an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. She hadn’t shopped there in years, but hell, she figured she’d get something cute. The store had just opened and was pretty quiet. There was only one other shopper, a young girl who looked like she was skipping classes. Two salespeople stalked the floor, on the lookout for commission. One was already helping the other shopper. The other, a slightly scruffy hunk that looked like he should be a model, lounged by the sales counter. Candice idly wondered what it’d be like to fuck his brains out with her new and improved body, then mentally scolded herself. She browsed for a bit, and picked out a ruffled mini-skirt and a cute tank top similar to what she’d seen a lot of college kids wearing lately. She’d wanted to wear something like this for a while, but hadn’t had the figure until today.  </p>
<p>“You want to try that on?” Candice turned to see the hunk, whose name tag said “Kevin,” standing behind her. “I can open the changing rooms if you want.” She was momentarily breathless, up close he was even more handsome, in that slightly scruffy surfer kind of way. He wore a slim-fit tee and sported a dark tan. Candice imagined he must have six-pack abs. Involuntarily, her eyes were drawn down to his crotch. His shorts were loose fitting, but from what she could tell, it was a pretty good size. She imagined him ramming it into her on the beach.  </p>
<p>“You OK?” he asked. Candice shook her head, clearing her thoughts.  </p>
<p>“I’m fine. Yeah, I’d like to try this on.” She followed him back to the changing room, out of sorts. Something was wrong. She looked at him again, critically. Yes, he was handsome. Yes, he was fit. But he was no model. She shouldn’t be this way — it must be Master PC. She must have turned her sexuality up too much. She would have to get home and turn it down. She resolved to buy the clothes, head straight home, and fix it.  </p>
<p>He’d opened the changing room for her, so she stepped in and tried on the outfit. The mini was short and flirty, showing off her legs. The top stretched across her chest. She could see her bra straps, though, and they didn’t match the top at all, so she took the tank off, discarded her bra, and tried it on again. Thanks to Master PC, she didn’t really need a bra anyway. Her breasts were perky under the fabric, and that wasn’t all. Now clearly visible, her nipples were erect like little tent poles. She reached up and touched one, and an electric shock went through her body. She felt something run down her thigh, and realized how wet she was. Her panties were soaked. She pulled them off, and set them with her bra. If her nipples had felt that good… she reached down and slid a finger in. She wasn’t ready for what she felt next. Pure pleasure coursed through her body. She lost her footing, and landed on the changing room’s bench.   </p>
<p>“Are you OK in there?” she heard Kevin ask. Candice managed a grunt in the affirmative. She was too busy exploring her pussy. She was so turned on… thoughts of Richard fucking her with her new mini bunched up around her waist flashed through her mind as she fingered herself with one hand, the other stroking a nipple through her top. She thought of Kevin, the Greek God of Abercrombie and Fitch, as he fucked her mouth from the other side, his cock filling her throat. Then she came, as hard as she ever had in her life, her juices making a puddle on the bench. She tried to stay quiet, but she couldn’t help but moan as the waves of pleasure shot through her.  </p>
<p>“Miss? Did you hear me? Are you alright?” She realized he’d only heard her fall and moan afterward. It was so nice for him to be concerned about her. She should reward him, she thought. </p>
<p>“I’d be better with you in here,” she said, opening the door.</p>
<p>Kevin stared in shock for a moment. Candice was embarrassed and turned on at the same time, knowing what she must look like to him: some slut with hard nipples and a soaking pussy inviting him into the changing room. But clearly, Kevin decided that chances like this don’t come along very often. He looked down the hallway to make sure no one saw and stepped in, locking the door behind him. Candice pulled him against her body. Her mini was, as in her fantasy, bunched up around her waist. As her breasts pressed against him, her nipples screamed pleasure into her brain, even with the fabric of her top between them. Kevin immediately began kissing her deeply, his tongue playing with hers as his hand found her wet pussy. He slid his finger in, and she felt her muscles clamp around it, hungry for something to be inside her. They broke their passionate kiss, and stared into each other’s eyes for a moment that seemed to go on forever.   </p>
<p>“Fuck me,” she said.  </p>
<p>Kevin nodded. She helped him pull off his tee, and then bent down, taking his pants off. His erect cock sprang into her face. It was bigger than Richard’s - it must have been seven inches long. She’d never been a very oral person, but his cock was so beautiful it made her mouth water. She tentatively kissed the head. He moaned encouragement, so she took it deeper, her lips wrapping around the shaft. She flicked her tongue around the head, and he moaned again. She felt him grab her hair as he began to pump it in and out of her mouth, and she simply lost herself in the moment. Kneeling there in front of him, one hand on his cock, guiding it as he fucked her mouth, the other fingering her clit, Candice was in heaven. He reached down with a free hand and grabbed one of her tits, pinching her nipple. Candice didn’t really like having her nipples pinched, but despite the pain, the pleasure was unbearable, and she immediately started to cum, moaning around his cock. She felt him tense, ready for his cum… and then he stopped, pulling out. What was wrong? She looked up at him, desperate for more. Apparently, he misunderstood the look.   </p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” Kevin said, “I’m going to do more than just that.” More? All she could do was whimper. He spun her around, and she felt his erection, wet with her spit against her ass. She bent over, propping herself up on the changing room bench, exposing her dripping pussy to him. He was bigger than she was comfortable with, but with the amount of lubrication she was producing, he slid in quickly. His cock filled her up, and even though from somewhere in her mind a tiny voice screamed at her for cheating on Richard, mostly all she could do was think that this was the best fuck she’d ever had in her life.   </p>
<p>“Oh God, Kevin. Oh, God..... fuuuuuck meeeee....” she didn’t care if anyone heard her. She would have shouted it if she could, but she felt like all her energy was going into the fucking. Kevin pounded her mercilessly. In, out. In, out. It was perfect. Her tits swung free in rhythm with his thrusts and her nipples were so sensitive even the air brushing against them felt amazing. She started to cum again, her pussy massaging his cock. She heard Kevin groan, felt him tense.   </p>
<p>“Yes, please, Kevin! Cum in me.... please....” She felt the first hot spurts of his jism inside her and her pussy went wild, the muscles undulating, as if trying to milk him of all his semen… “Yes! Cum in meeeeee!” she kept screaming as he shot his load into her, in this perfect moment of pure sex.   </p>
<p>How long did they stay like that after it was over, her pussy twitching around his cock? Candice wasn’t sure, it must have been just a few seconds. It felt longer. Finally, Kevin pulled out, his cock coated with juices.  </p>
<p>“That was amazing,” he said. “Um… can I get your number?”  </p>
<p>Candice didn’t know what to do. Her libido satiated, she was coming back to her senses, and the realization that she’d just cheated on Richard hit her like a ton of bricks. She didn’t know what to say. She quickly gave Kevin a fake number, ran out of the store, and jumped in the car. Her tires screeched as she tore out of the parking lot on the way home. She knew one thing. She had to change herself back before something like this happened again!</p>

<h2 id="part-2-pumping-the-brakes">Part 2: Pumping the Brakes</h2>
<p>Candice stared at the screen. In front of her, a perfect 3D rendering of herself floated in the Master PC window. As soon as she’d gotten home, Candice had quickly set the “sexuality” slider back to 30%.</p>
<p>She’d found some help files in the install directory and had been poring over them. Sometimes they explained an aspect of Master PC in a very straightforward manner. Other times, they were obtuse and circular in their descriptions. But she had learned a lot. The “Sexuality” slider went from 0% to 273%. She had, therefore, assumed that 100% was the normal baseline, and above that were those raging nymphos from the stories. But it wasn’t. It turned out 100% was the maximum level of sexuality a normal human body was capable of. Anyone over that number would literally die from sex. Above 100, they would generally start ignoring things like food and sleep. But by the 200s, an orgasm would short-circuit the brain in such a way that a person would be essentially catatonic. </p>
<p>Extreme caution must be taken, the help file noted, to harden the body and mind when setting the Master Sexuality slider this high.</p>
<p>Candice shuddered at the thought of what she could have done to herself. She resolved to start taking things slow. She began opening the profiles of as many other people as she could think of and comparing them. She discovered that normal human sexuality seemed to exist in a fairly tight range. There wasn’t enough data to do a really great analysis, but she suspected this was a typical bell curve. Most people seemed to hover in the 40s to 50s. She found a few people in the 60s (usually younger folks, and more likely than not to be men) and a few like herself in the 30s (more likely to be women or older folks). She only found one person she knew below the 30s, a girl she only knew in passing from college who identified as Asexual. Surprisingly, the highest she found was her neighbor in the apartment across the hall. Mildred was 83 years old and 68% sexual. You go girl, Candice thought.</p>
<p>After that she pulled up a few famous people. The first was a well-known actor from the Marvel movies. She could see his settings, but the controls were grayed out. She wondered if there was a geographical range, so she found a random person who lived in Japan and opened their profile. It worked. So someone — or something — was blocking out famous people? She found a list of billionaires and tried to load one of the less famous ones. A password prompt appeared. Huh. Even more protected. She decided against even trying anyone else. The Master PC Police would probably come after her if she even thought about messing with the President of the United States.</p>
<p>She wondered again who or what had created the program. Aliens? A wizard? A god? The God? There was no hint anywhere in the documentation.</p>
<p>Candice decided to go back to fixing herself. She had already undone the change to her sexuality. She began to undo her physical changes as well, but as soon as she did, she felt those extra 30 pounds immediately. It wasn’t pleasant. Ugh.</p>
<p>OK, maybe I won’t undo all the physical changes, she thought. She dropped herself back down 20 pounds and clicked Apply again. She was still ten pounds over where she was earlier in the day, but it was definitely a lot more comfortable. She decided to use this as an experiment. Would she be able to explain away the weight loss when someone inevitably asked? There was an entire section of Master PC called “Secondary Control Effects.” These were things like “Commanding Voice,” “Hypnotic Eyes” and “Pheromones.” They all seemed to be effects that didn’t change the subject, but allowed the subject to change other people. Here there was an option called Acceptance that the documentation seemed to indicate would cause others to not notice changes in the affected. You could turn someone blonde or give them giant boobs and suddenly everyone would just accept that as normal. Candice considered using that on herself to disguise her weight loss, but the documentation was unclear if it would affect herself. What if she turned it on and then accidentally turned herself into a sex-crazed maniac again? Would she accept that she had always been that way instead of changing herself back? She couldn’t risk it.</p>
<p>She did give herself the Command Voice, though. According to what she was reading, it could be used fairly well as a fallback to make people ignore changes, at least to an extent. Plus, she wanted to try it out. So often in the Master PC stories, the program was used to turn some smart, confident woman into a brainless sexbot. She liked the idea of using it for non-sexual stuff.</p>
<p>She considered upping her own intelligence. Maybe she could reason through this thing a bit better if she was smarter. But again, what if she messed it up? What if she turned herself into an emotionless logical machine? The Mental section was a maze of options and configurations: Puzzle-solving, Emotional Perception, Logic, Induction, Spatial Reasoning, Calculations. All of those and more were present and those often had multiple sub-sections. And there was basically no documentation for any of it. Clearly this wasn’t what most people were using Master PC for.</p>
<p>She needed someone else to experiment on. It needed to be someone other than herself, but someone she could keep an eye on. There was really only one option. She pulled up Richard. </p>
<p>She browsed around his personality and mental tab a bit. The Personality Indices were hard to follow. Here Master PC displayed an oddly shaped 3D model with different personality traits mapped out like “Empathy,” “Conscientiousness,” and “Leadership.” As she moved some scroll bars, it began to distort. She thought she’d made changes to him for a moment, before realizing it was just changing the view. More personality traits came onto the screen as others disappeared.</p>
<p>The Human Personality, someone had written in the documentation, is here represented in a seven-dimensional space flattened into a 3D model for easier viewing. It is recommended to simply use the Sexuality tab for most use-cases.</p>
<p>Well, that wasn’t helpful. She did notice that Richard’s self-confidence was low. She double-checked it against several other people to be sure. Candice had always suspected he had some deep self-doubt, this was just confirmation. She decided to fix that. If he became an insufferable prick, she could always turn it back down.</p>
<p>She began to dig into the Intelligence settings on his Mental tab. Comparing him to several other people, it seemed like Richard was already a little smarter than average. But not quite as smart as herself, Candice noted with some smugness. </p>
<p>Well, not for long. He was about to become the smarter of the pair. Candice turned up his Induction, Deduction, a few related values until they were a bit higher than her own. She’d watch him to make sure he didn’t turn into a Vulcan or something and, if the changes seemed safe, she’d apply them to herself after a few days.</p>
<p>She saw his avatar stand up on screen and realized he had made it home. They lived downtown, about halfway up an apartment high-rise. She watched him as his avatar mimed parking his bike and walking to the elevator.</p>
<p>She grabbed her laptop and moved to the couch, sitting against the wall so he wouldn’t be able to see the screen. A few minutes later the door opened. </p>
<p>“Hey, hon!” he called out. “Feeling any better?” Oops, she’d forgotten she was supposed to be sick.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” she lied. “Mostly. I was throwing up a lot this morning, but I’m mostly better now. I think it’s one of those 24-hour stomach bugs.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah,” he said, “I had that last month. Do you think you’ll want food tonight?”</p>
<p>They continued chatting the rest of the evening. Candice watched him for any personality changes, ready to revert what she’d done at a moment’s notice. But no red flags surfaced. He wasn’t some insufferable overly-confident buffoon. He wasn’t a super-genius either. He didn’t even notice the weight loss! Admittedly, she was wearing her loose-fitting “fat” clothes, but still. Twenty pounds is a lot when you’re 5‘3”! Richard had never been the most observant guy in the world, and the normalcy of it was kind of reassuring.</p>
<p>They ended up ordering Thai and watching Netflix. When they started the second episode, Richard put his arm around her and began gently rubbing her arm in a way that, after all these years together, she knew meant that he was interested in sex. Candice considered if this was anything to take note of. As far as Richard knew, she was still a little sick. Would he have tried that normally? Was this an indication of higher self-confidence? Or was she reading too much into it, and it was just that they hadn’t done it in nearly two weeks? It was hard to tell.</p>
<p>Sex. It was a subject she’d been trying to avoid thinking about all afternoon. The thought of Kevin fucking her in the changing room in the Abercrombie and Fitch flashed through her head again. The way she’d sucked his cock, the way he’d bent her over and fucked her senseless. She felt a deep sense of arousal thinking of it, as well as an equally deep sense of guilt over what she’d done. This whole thing with Master PC had started because she was worried about Richard straying, but she was the one who’d cheated. She hadn’t been in her right mind, but she knew it wasn’t an excuse. She’d sullied their marriage in a way that she knew Richard would never forgive if he found out, and she’d never really forgive herself for it either. She couldn’t undo it, she could only try to make amends. She swore to herself she’d use Master PC to make both their lives better, and to make their marriage stronger.</p>
<p>Maybe she should just lean into the sex tonight, she thought. Richard wanted it, and she owed it to him. Of course, no man was owed sex from a woman. That was a bedrock principle to Candice, and one that Richard agreed with. It was one of the reasons she loved the guy. But tonight, honestly, she did kind of owe him. </p>
<p>The problem was, she didn’t really want to. The thought of sex right now just wasn’t all that appealing. Only thinking back to the sex earlier in the day brought any sense of arousal.</p>
<p>“I’ll be right back,” Candice said. </p>
<p>Richard tried to hide his disappointment as she left his embrace and headed for the bathroom. She grabbed her laptop on the way and pulled her own profile back up. 80% sexuality had been far too high. But now she knew what most people’s numbers were. She turned herself and Richard up to 55%. Plenty of normal people were higher than that. Besides, she reasoned, even if something somehow went wrong, she’d managed to fix things before. She could do it again. She clicked Apply, closed the laptop, and headed back to the living room, snuggling back up with Richard. </p>
<p>This time, when he put his arm around her, Candice rested her hand on his lap and began making little circles with her thumb. It was the beginning of the little mating dance they’d developed over the years.</p>
<p>“I thought you were sick,” Richard said, smiling.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m feeling much better.”</p>
<p>He skipped a couple steps of foreplay and kissed her deeply. Candice melted into it. She’d only bumped Richard’s sexuality up a few percentage points, but her own increase had been much more significant. She responded with an unusual amount of enthusiasm, running her hands along his crotch, feeling his erection already swelling. The room seemed to crackle with sexual energy as their makeout session became more intense, like teenagers who were worried their parents would get home any minute.</p>
<p>Richard slid his hand under her shirt and she moaned as he began to play with her nipples. Candice’s nipples had always been very sensitive, but this was a whole new level. Only Kevin had made them feel this good before. She tried to banish the thought from her mind. Richard was her husband, Kevin was a one-time thing. </p>
<p>“Man, you really are feeling better,” Richard joked, as he ran his hand down her back, past her waistline, and grabbed her butt just the way she liked. </p>
<p>“Yeah,” Candice laughed. “God, I want it bad tonight, hun.”</p>
<p>“Mmmm, I can tell,” he said, as he pulled her shirt off. </p>
<p>“Woah!” he exclaimed.</p>
<p>“What?” Candice asked, suddenly gripped with panic. Did he somehow know about Master PC? Kevin? What was it?</p>
<p>“You’ve lost a ton of weight! How did I not notice?”</p>
<p>“Oh,” she replied. “Yeah. I’ve been working at it for a while.”</p>
<p>“Huh,” he said. “It’s funny how when someone is losing or gaining weight, you just don’t notice until one day you do.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Candice agreed. “Funny.” She decided to try something.</p>
<p>“I’ve been hitting the gym on my lunch break lately. YOU SHOULD GO TO THE GYM SOME TOO,” she said, putting the Command Voice into it. The sound that left her lips was uncanny. It was her voice, but it was also more. Underlying her natural tone, a subtle but powerful series of harmonic chords seemed to vibrate in the air around the words.</p>
<p>Richard blinked, as if he’d just been hit in the head with a rock. “Yeah,” he agreed after a second. “I really should.”</p>
<p>“Anyway, where were we?” asked Candice, grinning.</p>
<p>“Right,” he said, leaning in.</p>
<p>They went back to making out, but not for long. Richard was eager, and Candice equally so. When Richard’s hand slid into her pants, Candice was surprised at how easily he was able to slip his fingers in, and how good it felt as they worked her pussy. He pulled her pants down and lowered his face to begin licking her clit, as he always did. Candice was capable of vaginal orgasms, but only after a “warm up” clitoral one. It was the one thing that, therefore, never varied in their lovemaking.</p>
<p>“No,” she said. “You don’t need to tonight.” She guided his head back up to hers and bit his ear playfully. She opened her legs slightly, letting him slide between them, and began tugging his pants off.</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” Richard asked, skeptically.</p>
<p>“I need it bad, Tiger.” </p>
<p>He didn’t need any more convincing. They wiggled the rest of the way out of their clothes, and didn’t even try to make it to the bedroom. Richard felt amazing as he entered Candice, his cock like a fiery spear. He began thrusting immediately, hitting Candice’s g-spot with a precision that only an old lover could possess. </p>
<p>She wrapped her legs around him as he pumped in and out of her. He was more insistent than normal, more passionate. At once familiar and new. They didn’t talk dirty, didn’t kiss deeply. It was pure, raw fucking and Candice just laid back and enjoyed the ride. It was wonderful. Candice came first, then a second time as well. Richard was still going.</p>
<p>“Oh God,” Candice said. “God, Richard, this is so amazing. I want it… I’m about to cum again. Cum with me, Richard.” She closed her eyes as her third orgasm began, her pussy gripping his cock. In her head, she saw Kevin. Kevin, pumping in and out of her, spinning her around and fucking her pussy from behind in that changing room stall. As the orgasm reached a crescendo, she remembered how amazing her nipples had felt at 80% sexual, how the air itself had seemed to caress them as they swung in the air. She reached up and pinched them herself, trying to recapture the feeling. It felt almost as good. She felt Kevin climax as well, his cock pulsing as he emptied his load into her. Richard cumming, she corrected herself. Not Kevin. Richard.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes and smiled. Richard was smiling back.</p>
<p>“Wow,” was all he said. He bent down and kissed her tenderly. She kissed him back.</p>
<p>They made their way to bed, Netflix forgotten, and fell asleep quickly. That night, Candice had the most erotic dreams of her life. Dreams of Kevin.</p>

<h2 id="part-3-arm-candy">Part 3: Arm Candy</h2>
<p>Candice reclined in her office chair. She’d finished her work for the day, having squashed a particularly difficult-to-find bug in the company website. Now she was just playing with Master PC, as she had been doing every day for the last two weeks.</p>
<p>She was becoming a real Master PC power user. She brought her personal laptop to work and kept it open on her desk, occasionally opening people’s profiles and learning what made everyone tick. Whenever anyone asked about it, she told them to “IGNORE THAT LAPTOP” using the Command Voice. After that, it was like it wasn’t there.</p>
<p>Richard had started hitting the gym for an hour every morning before work, and Candice had continued to drop his weight and increase his muscle mass a little each day. Richard was amazed how much progress he was making, and how quick it was going. She had also dialed a few years off both of them. Not just superficial years this time, real biological years. It felt amazing being suddenly younger. She was also dropping her own weight a bit more. Getting that last ten pounds off and all.</p>
<p>Of course she could be learning a lot more if she would just change people. She was sure that’s how most people with Master PC did it. Get a harem and start making changes and see what all the sliders did by trial and error. But Candice had morals, she wasn’t going to go down that road. Her main goal right now was figuring out how to use Master PC to become independently wealthy, but there wasn’t anything obvious besides becoming a Scarlett Johansen lookalike and starting an OnlyFans. And, again, she didn’t want to use Master PC mainly for sex. Even if that was clearly its intended purpose.</p>
<p>She could probably force a wealthy person to just give her a lot of money, but she’d already seen many of them were protected somehow, and she didn’t want to draw any undue attention. So yesterday she’d mentioned to her boss’s boss that she would be a “GOOD CANDIDATE FOR PROMOTION.” Now she had a meeting next week with him to discuss her future at the company. Richard was doing well at his job too. He worked at a bank, doing some kind of financial analytics. His increased intelligence and self-confidence had been helping him get noticed. It was only a matter of time before he got a promotion as well, she figured.</p>
<p>She had bumped his self-confidence up a couple more times since that first day. She had just decided to keep doing it until she noticed a difference, and that had finally started happening in the last few days. He was now actually a bit more confident than average, but she wasn’t sure she liked it. He was definitely more take-charge now, and Candice was used to wearing the proverbial pants in the relationship. </p>
<p>He was also hitting on her more, but Candice didn’t mind that at all. They’d been doing it nearly every day since she’d found Master PC. She definitely got why people used it for sex. She’d never known it could be so good.</p>
<p>That was one of her problems. Every time they did it, she was thinking of Kevin. Every single fucking time. Her mind would wander back to that fitting room, and the best sex of her life. Objectively, he wasn’t that amazing. She had idly browsed Kevin’s profile a few times. Looking at him in Master PC, without the sex-goggles on, he wasn’t even that hot. Richard was better looking, especially with the tweaks Candice had made to him. But in her head, Kevin was basically the God of Sex, the male version of Aphrodite who had come down to earth and given Candice an experience she just couldn’t shake. She felt something building inside herself, a longing that made her worried she was going to do something stupid and cheat again.</p>
<p>She’d considered trying to erase her own memory of that event, but the docs warned against that heavily. Messing with your own memory was a recipe for disaster, it seemed. At least according to whoever had written the ReadMe files.</p>
<p>It was ironic that Master PC was created to make sex easy, but that was the one area she was actually struggling with. The entire reason she’d upped her sexuality in the first place was to make herself and Richard more sexually compatible. And sure, they were having sex more. But she had been keeping an eye on his “Sexual Attraction” numbers and his attraction to Candice had barely budged. In fact, his old girlfriend Nicole was the one going up! Candice knew for a fact he hadn’t had any contact with her, but he was definitely thinking about her the same way Candice was thinking about Kevin. </p>
<p>She made a decision. This couldn’t stand. With the god-like power of Master PC at her fingertips, this was something she could fix. And she knew the solution. She was going to turn her sexuality back up and fuck Richard. And she was going to temporarily turn Richard up at the same time. She was going to give him the night of his life, and after that they’d only think about each other.</p>
<p>OK, she thought, time to get to work. What does Nicole have that I don’t?</p>
<p>She pulled up all three of their profiles. Her own, Richard’s and Nicole’s, and began digging. An hour later, she had it. </p>
<p>Richard was rated at 112 Dominant on a scale of 0 to 180. It was another seemingly random scale of numbers, although really when it used percentages they weren’t much more helpful. She clicked on his “Dominant” slider to get more detail, and several check boxes populated next to it. “When aroused” was checked. Ahhh, so he was dominant in bed, and basically wanted a normal relationship otherwise. Well, that wasn’t so bad. It also explained all the mind control porn he’d been reading lately. Probably, turning up his sexuality had made him want to exercise that fantasy even more.</p>
<p>Comparatively, Candice’s Dominance was 43. Interestingly “When Aroused” wasn’t checked for herself. She just kind of liked to be in charge. Yeah, that tracked.</p>
<p>Nicole’s profile was more interesting. She had two little dots on the slider. One at Dominant 5, another at -93. When the negative dot was selected, the word “Dominance” changed to “Submission” and “when aroused” became checked. So Nicole was pretty middle-of-the-road normally, but submissive in bed. Interesting! And her submission matched Richard’s dominance pretty closely. </p>
<p>OK, Candice thought, now we’re cooking! Candice knew Nicole pretty well, they’d all been in the same friend group in college. She’d always seemed pretty normal, so if her dominance/submission was at -93, it was probably a safe number. Just to be sure, Candice checked around a few more people she knew. She found a couple people in the office with numbers slightly higher, which was reassuring.</p>
<p>Candice fired off a text to Richard. </p>
<p>&gt; I hit my goal weight today! 🥳</p>
<p>&gt; Really? You’re still losing weight???</p>
<p>&gt; Not anymore! Down to my college weight, baby!</p>
<p>&gt; Wow, congrats</p>
<p>&gt; We’re going to celebrate tonight 💦</p>
<p>&gt; We’ve been celebrating a lot lately 😆</p>
<p>&gt; Extra celebration tonight then. Anything you want tonight 😈</p>
<p>&gt; Anything?</p>
<p>&gt; Anything.</p>
<p>&gt; You’re on!!!</p>
<p>The rest of the day crawled by. Candice’s mind kept going to what she was planning to do with Richard tonight. Thoughts of Kevin danced through her head, and for once she didn’t bat them away. After tonight, she assured herself, Richard would be the one she fantasized about. </p>
<p>When 3:00 hit, she was out the door. She had some experimenting to do, and it required privacy. </p>
<p>“Leaving early?” asked her boss.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Candice said, before adding, “IT’S FINE FOR ME TO LEAVE A LITTLE EARLY.” The harmonics of the Command Voice rippled through his brain and he just nodded and went back to work.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“OK, no fuckups this time,” she said aloud. She had her own profile pulled up. She had kept her dominance where it was, but she’d added a new dot on the Dominance/Submission slider. She’d set it to -20 and triple-checked that “When Aroused” was selected. </p>
<p>This was a little scary. She’d read several of the same stories Richard had, knew the tropes. Girls sapped of their free will, blindly obedient to their masters. She couldn’t risk that happening to herself, and she knew Master PC was more than capable of it if she messed something up like she had that first day.</p>
<p>Of course she’d found plenty of people with their submission at much higher numbers, usually when aroused. Logically it should be safe, but Candice wasn’t going to be stupid. She was starting slow. She clicked Apply.</p>
<p>Did she feel any different? Did she want to serve Richard as his personal servant? Nope, in fact the idea still vaguely repulsed her. She pulled up the erotic stories site again, and picked a story that, from his phone’s browser history, she knew he’d read several times. Cheap, by someone who went by Limerick.</p>
<p>She read the first few sections. It was about a couple named Jack and Kylie who were slowly being turned into sex maniacs by the local TV station. The story was well-written, but she didn’t really get the appeal. She turned up her submission a bit and kept reading. Halfway through and still nothing. She turned it up some more.</p>
<p>OK, now she was beginning to get a little turned on. Losing control like that could be pretty hot. And the amount of sex they were having was really appealing. As someone who had been pretty sexless up until a few weeks ago, she understood wanting to give into the changes. She increased her submissiveness a bit more. By the time Jack’s boss had been turned into a slut and was sucking his cock, Candice had her vibrator out and was cumming right along with the characters. </p>
<p>It was wild, she reflected, to edit her own sexual kinks and feel the ramifications in real time. Just as an experiment she dropped the submissiveness down again. And just like that, the story wasn’t sexy anymore. Then she turned her submissiveness into dominance. Now the story was hot again, but she was imagining herself as the people running the TV station, corrupting the town into a bunch of bimbos and himbos.</p>
<p>Neat, but not what she was after. That wouldn’t make her compatible with Richard. She set her submissiveness back down, settling on -90. It made the submission incredibly hot, even if she still wasn’t quite as submissive as Nicole. But this number would be safe, and safe was her watchword now.</p>
<p>OK, now time for step two. She needed to make sure her night with Richard made her forget Kevin. She went to her sexuality tab. The master Sexuality control was at 57%. Odd. She was sure she’d set it at 55% before. She knew no one else was messing with her either — she’d password protected herself a few days ago. She pulled up the ReadMe file. Master PC’s documentation was severely lacking in a lot of places, but the Sexuality files were the opposite. There was so much written, it was hard to process it all. </p>
<p>Sexuality is not a fixed number, she found deep in one of the text files. It is a live statistic indicating the target’s current overall sexuality. Some amount of natural variance is to be expected. Experiencing good sex can cause the subject to like sex more, thus increasing the number, though there are biological limits to natural increases. Traumatic sexual experiences, age, and hormone changes can have the opposite effect. To prevent this, right-click the control, and select “Lock”....</p>
<p>She stopped reading. She wasn’t interested in locking her sexuality into a certain number forever. At least she had an answer. She had been having a lot of good sex lately, and that made her want it more. It made sense. In fact, knowing that a number set in Master PC wasn’t necessarily forever made her a little more confident in her plan.</p>
<p>She set her Master Sexuality to 70%. She’d opened up a lot of people’s profiles. The high 60s were pretty much the province of horny teenage boys. Seventy would put her a hair above that, but still within the range of a normal human. She thought about 80% again, wanted 80% again, but knew it was too dangerous.</p>
<p>But she had a plan. Below the Master Sexuality setting was a plethora of sub-categories and controls. If the Master Sexuality slider was a sledgehammer, these were the screwdrivers and scalpels, able to make targeted changes. Candice was interested in hitting that same orgasmic high she’d experienced with Kevin without the danger of cheating on her husband. Below, she could change her “arousal curve.” She lowered it at the beginning, raised it at the end. She’d now ramp up to 80% levels, but slower, not turning into a slut from the feel of fabric on her nipples.</p>
<p>She increased her O-Index. There were actually a lot of sub-categories (sub-sub-categories?) below that, like O-Multiplier and O-Profundity. She stuck to the top-line number, copying over what she’d experienced at 80% to her new, less-horny 70% self. She gave her new statistics a careful double-check, and then a triple-check. It was all as safe as she could make it. She clicked “Apply” and felt the familiar shiver as the changes took effect. </p>
<p>Now for Richard. She turned him up as well. He had never experienced 80% before, so he didn’t really need to be as high, but Candice wanted to make sure he could satisfy her. She turned his Master Sexuality slider up to 65%, then dug into the sub-menus. As a guy, his settings were slightly different. She quickly found the one she was looking for and turned down his Refractory Period. There wasn’t really any guessing what was a safe number here, the documentation was pretty clear about how it worked. Even when it came to a magical computer program she was living in a world designed for men, Candice thought ruefully. She increased his penis size too. Kevin had been a little bigger than Richard, and she’d enjoyed it. She didn’t know if Richard would notice, but she figured she could use the Voice to make him think it was fine if he questioned it.</p>
<p>She clicked “Apply” again. Now she just had to wait for him to get home. She checked the clock, 4:45. She had thirty minutes to kill before he got home. </p>
<p>OK, a few more changes, she decided. She pulled her own profile back up and re-implemented most of the changes she’d made on the first day and then some. Candice shaped her eyebrows, removed every ounce of excess fat from her body, gave herself perfect skin, made her nose just a bit smaller, and increased her breast size, among a myriad of other small changes. She clicked “Apply” just as Richard arrived home.</p>
<p>She closed the laptop and rushed into the living room just as Richard walked in.</p>
<p>“Hey, you’re home!” she exclaimed, already excited for what she knew was about to happen. She tried to keep it light, easy, not giving away that just the sight of him set her pussy on fire. She’d turned down the initial side of her arousal curve, but the last hour of anticipation already had her very, very ready to go. Richard smiled back, and there was a definite gleam in his eye. </p>
<p>“I bought some wine…” Candice began, but Richard cut her off.</p>
<p>“God, Candice, you look amazing!” Candice looked down, and saw some definite movement in his pants as he looked her over.</p>
<p>“Well, you know, the clothes help too…” Candice did a kind of twirl, showing off the outfit she’d bought on the way home. It was a ruffled skirt and tank top, basically the same outfit she’d fucked Kevin in. As she finished her spin, Richard grabbed her and pulled her close. Her nipples were so hard now, just the pressure from squeezing against him set off fireworks. He reached down and tilted Candice’s head up and began to kiss her. She remembered, idly, how Richard had always been such a gentle lover up until two weeks ago. There was nothing gentle in this kiss, though. Just raw unbridled lust. She moaned as his tongue entered her mouth.</p>
<p>Then he broke the kiss, stared into her eyes, and said the words she’d been waiting to hear.</p>
<p>“We’re going out tonight,” he said</p>
<p>Wait, what?</p>
<p>“What?” she said out loud. “But, I… but…”</p>
<p>“You said anything I wanted, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” she said, the words tumbling out of her mouth. “Anything you want,” and Candice knew she meant them, the submissiveness kicking in. “I just thought you’d want to…. You know.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I do,” Richard replied with a smirk. “But it’s barely 5:30. I want to make a full evening of things. That’ll be the climax of the night, pun intended.”</p>
<p>Candice nodded. “Whatever you want. I said it, and I meant it. So where are we going?”</p>
<p>“Fox Theater, I made reservations after you sent the text.”</p>
<p>Fox Theater was the nicest place in town. It was an old movie theater from the 1920s. After sitting empty for almost 50 years, someone had finally bought it and turned it into a restaurant. There was an open kitchen underneath the screen, and they showed public-domain silent movies there while you ate. No one really watched the movie, it was more of an ambiance thing. But the theater was gorgeous on the inside, a big open space made of heavy beams and dark wood. </p>
<p>“OK,” Candice said, trying to gain control of her libido. “Let me find something nice to wear.” There was, of course, a dress code at Fox Theater.</p>
<p>“Way ahead of you,” Richard replied. “I’ve got tonight planned out. You still have that red dress you bought for Valentine’s Day when we were in college, right?”</p>
<p>“Uh… it’s at the back of my closet. But I haven’t been that thin in years. Plus, I’ve never worn it out in public. That was just a me and you thing.”</p>
<p>“Anything I want tonight, right?”</p>
<p>The gleam in his eye was so sexy. Richard didn’t usually just take charge like this, and Candice knew normally she’d be mad he was pushing this. But she wasn’t mad at him, she realized. Suddenly she was mad at herself for questioning it.</p>
<p>“Yes sir,” she said jokingly. But saying it felt so right. Goddam she was horny. She went to her closet, to the very back to find “The Dress” as she’d always thought of it. She had known she looked good in it when she bought it, but it was just too much to wear in public. She’d originally planned to wear it out on Valentine’s Day during sophomore year, but she’d chickened out and made sure they didn’t leave the bedroom that particular night. She’d put on weight after college, but always hoped she would fit into it again one day.</p>
<p>Today was that day. It was tight, with a low square neck and a very daring thigh-high slit. She fished it out from the recesses of her closet and stepped into the master bathroom to get ready. She pulled it on, feeling the fabric hugging every inch of her body. She avoided looking into the mirror while she struggled into it. Last time she’d tried to put it on, she’d been depressed for a week. Finally, after pressing out all the wrinkles, she got up her nerve and turned to face the mirror.</p>
<p>Holy shit! She looked just as good as she had all those years ago. No, better.</p>
<p>Candice had always been hourglass shaped. Wide hips, with a decent set of boobs. She’d always been pretty — maybe not the prettiest girl around, but Candice had always thought she was an easy 7 or 8, or at least she had been in her prime. But this new her? A perfect 10. </p>
<p>It wasn’t just her physique either, it was all the little changes she’d made with Master PC as well. Her hair was perfect and shiny, falling around her face in dark brown waves. Her face was young and blemish-free, more beautiful than it had ever been in ways she couldn’t quite place. Her stomach was flat, her legs toned with not even the slightest hint of cellulite to be seen. And then there were her boobs. She’d forgotten she’d turned them up a bit. They weren’t objectively huge, but on her newer, more slender body they looked a bit oversized. Candice was down to her college weight everywhere but her chest. The girls were as big as they’d ever been, and far perkier. They strained against the dress, looking like they wanted to escape, practically bursting over the neckline.</p>
<p>And she looked like this without even putting any makeup on! She didn’t need much, she realized. She looked like one of those TikTok girls who took an hour to achieve a “natural” look. A little bit of blush, some smokey eye, and dark red lipstick to match the dress and the look was complete. Maybe, she decided, she could still convince Richard to stay in for the night. </p>
<p>Richard was waiting when she stepped out of the bathroom. He was already dressed in a nice shirt and slacks. Guys had it so easy getting ready to go out. He froze when he saw Candice. Like, legitimately froze for a second, unable to grasp what he was seeing. Candice grinned and walked over to him with her sexiest walk.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you still want to go out?” she purred. She knew she was just oozing sex with this look. She was already turned on, and making herself more so. She wanted to kneel down in front of her husband, to submit to him, to let him use her however he wanted. She walked seductively towards him, swaying her hips from side to side.</p>
<p>It took a beat for him to respond. “Come on,” he said. “We don’t want to be late.”</p>
<p>Noooo! Her brain was screaming. How could he be saying no to fucking her right now? What was happening? But she didn’t let it show. She knew she couldn’t let her man down.</p>
<p>“OK,” she said, hiding her disappointment.</p>
<p>They took an Uber to the restaurant; they usually did on nights Richard wanted to drink. Candice caught the driver checking her out several times. Richard was making small talk, something about how great his day had gone at work. Candice didn’t really know much about finance at the best of times, and in her current state it was basically impossible to focus on the boring numbers he was talking about. Her mind kept wandering to more carnal subjects. Richard’s hand was on her thigh, his thumb making small circles where her dress slit exposed her skin. </p>
<p>“Candice? Did you hear me?” She snapped back to reality. What had he been saying? </p>
<p>“Huh? What?”</p>
<p>“We’re here,” he said. She realized he was getting out of the car. He stepped around and opened her door, a small act of chivalry she usually would not have appreciated. But tonight it made her swoon.</p>
<p>“Someone’s a bit ditzy tonight,” Richard chuckled. He took her by the arm and led her into the restaurant. Candice felt all eyes on her as they entered. Every guy, and several women, were stealing looks at her. She couldn’t blame them, she knew what she looked like. With each step she took, her toned leg was revealed through the slit in her dress, a flash of smooth skin that drew even more attention. Her breasts, still straining against the neckline of her dress, seemed to defy gravity, practically begging to be admired.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, the hostess led them to their seats, but just as they were about to sit down Richard indicated another table.</p>
<p>“Is that one free?” he asked. Fox Theater had two floors of seating. The main floor, and a higher half-floor of balcony seating. That’s where they were now. The balcony itself was a shallow U-shape, and Richard was pointing at the seat at the center, right next to the balcony railing. The hostess agreed and sat them down. </p>
<p>“Your server will be here momentarily,” she said. “In the meantime, can I get you started with some drinks?”</p>
<p>“I’ll have a Whisky Sour,” Richard said, “And a lemon martini for the lady.” The hostess left to fill their drinks as Candice squirmed in her seat.</p>
<p>“Why here?” Candice asked as she sat down. </p>
<p>“Did you see all those men checking you out in the lobby?” Richard asked.</p>
<p>“Uh… yeah,” Candice admitted.</p>
<p>“I wanted to let everyone enjoy the show.”</p>
<p>“But, everyone can see the movie.” Candice looked at the screen. It was some Charlie Chaplin film, but she didn’t know enough to identify it. </p>
<p>Richard laughed. “You really are a bit out of it today, hon. No, you’re the show. Look around. Every guy is stealing glances at you. Everyone sitting on the balcony with us, when they look at the screen, they see you. I bet a lot of guys are going to be pretending to watch the movie tonight. And look down. Everyone on the first level who looks up at the balcony, you’re the first thing they’re going to see. Right here, on display.”</p>
<p>“You… you like men looking at me?” she asked, confused.</p>
<p>Richard put his hand on hers. “Yeah. It’s always been a bit of a fantasy for me. The whole ‘trophy wife’ thing. To have a beautiful woman on your arm. To know that every man in the room wishes he was me. Seeing other men stare at you really turns me on, I don’t know why.” He paused, watching her face. “But if you’re not comfortable with it, we can…”</p>
<p>“No,” Candice interrupted him. “Anything you want tonight,” she said. It was becoming her mantra for the evening.</p>
<p>“And I have to admit, it is pretty hot, seeing everyone look at me like this. I mean, when I was in college sometimes I’d get a creepy guy staring at me, and I hated it. But tonight I feel like everyone’s eyes are on me, and it’s getting me so wet.” She put her hand to her mouth. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to be so vulgar. But I am, honey. I’m so fucking horny.” </p>
<p>“Honestly, I can tell. Just look at those nipples,” her husband replied. “I didn’t know they could get that hard.”</p>
<p>Candice looked down and gasped. “Oh my god, I’m not wearing a bra!“</p>
<p>Now Richard laughed out loud. “You didn’t know?”</p>
<p>“No! I was still trying to seduce you into not leaving the house when I got dressed! I forgot to put one on before we left! Oh Jesus, everyone can see me like a… a… a slut!” the word landed with a thud. A word she’d seen a lot lately reading the mind-control porn Richard liked. And as soon as she said it, she saw the gleam in his eye, knew he loved her saying that about herself.</p>
<p>“You look like you can’t wait until we get home.”</p>
<p>“I know, honey,” Candice said, almost whining. “I’m soooooo turned on I can’t stand it.”</p>
<p>“Then touch yourself,” he said.</p>
<p>“Are you suggesting that I touch myself right now?” Candice asked, a little shocked.</p>
<p>“No. I’m ordering you to. Anything I want.”</p>
<p>Candice’s hand shot down immediately, almost of its own volition. Even though she was on display for everyone to see here, center stage on the balcony, she was oddly afforded some small bit of privacy. A fancy white tablecloth was draped partially covering her lap, and the slit in the side of her dress provided easy access for her fingers. If no one was paying attention, she probably could have slid her fingers in without anyone noticing.</p>
<p>But people were looking.  That just made it all the hotter as she started rubbing her clit. Distantly, she realized she wasn’t wearing any panties either. Normally Candice would have been aghast at the idea she’d been so close to flashing everyone in the restaurant as she walked in, but that didn’t matter to her at all right now. A look of surprise crossed Richard’s face. He clearly hadn’t been expecting her to actually do it, but his expression immediately turned to one of lust as he said nothing, simply staring at Candice as her fingers played with the entrance to her pussy. </p>
<p>Their drinks arrived. Candice barely noticed as the server put them down on the table. “Are you ready to order or do you need… uh…. a moment?” The server trailed off uncertainly. Candice didn’t stop touching herself. Richard hadn’t told her to stop. The server couldn’t see anything explicit, her hand was under her dress, but it was obvious to anyone this close what she was doing. </p>
<p>“I’ll, uh, give you another minute,” he said and quickly retreated.</p>
<p>“Fuck, honey,” Richard said, “You’re really into this aren’t you?”</p>
<p>Candice nodded. “Whatever you want. That’s what I said. I’ve never been this… submissive… before,” she said, putting emphasis on the word, knowing he’d love hearing her say it. “But I love it. This is so hot. I’ve never been this turned on in my life.”</p>
<p>She began rubbing herself faster and faster. Her fingers circled her clit, picking up speed. Her nipples were so erect they felt like they were going to burst through her dress and she squirmed in her chair with the pleasure. With her free hand she reached up and brushed her nipples through the fabric. I’m losing control, she realized. She needed to end this now.</p>
<p>“Honey… tell me to cum,” she practically begged.</p>
<p>“Are you serious?”</p>
<p>“Please,” she whimpered.</p>
<p>Richard looked at her, at first still unsure. He didn’t say anything, just stared deep into her eyes, boring into her soul as she rubbed herself. Candice felt her fingers slick with her juices, waiting for the order from her husband, her man, her master. Finally, he came to a decision.</p>
<p>“Cum,” he commanded.</p>
<p>And she did. Her body started shaking, her free hand gripped the table, trying to hold herself upright. She wanted to close her eyes, but as long as Richard stared at her, she felt like she had to return the stare. Behind him, she saw the couple at the next table were watching. The man had a “Is this really happening?” expression on his face, the woman had a look of absolute disgust. </p>
<p>The thrill of knowing that this kind of exhibitionism was a turn-on for Richard made her cum even harder. She started to sway, started to feel an involuntary scream escape her lips. Richard saved her from the scream. He leaned across the table and kissed her deeply and she melted into it, shaking, finally beginning to come down from her orgasm. </p>
<p>He broke the kiss, and her libido at least partly sated, Candice got a bit of her senses back. “I need to clean myself up,” she said and quickly got up from the table. Before she left, she picked up the martini and downed it in one go. She needed it tonight.</p>
<p>As she made her way to the restroom, all eyes were on her.</p>

<h2 id="part-4-the-woman-in-the-mirror">Part 4: The Woman in the Mirror</h2>
<p>“What the fuck is happening?” Candice said to herself, staring into the mirror. The upstairs restrooms at Fox Theater were small single-person affairs, and she was glad for the privacy.</p>
<p>She’d been using Master PC for two weeks. Two weeks! And she was basically already one of those sluts from the stories. She took a deep breath. Calm down, Candice. Calm down. Now that she’d cum, all the brain haziness and submissiveness associated with it had dissipated. She felt almost like her normal self again. This must be what guys are talking about when they say “post-nut clarity,” she thought ruefully.</p>
<p>OK, time to use some of that increased intelligence. She’d expected some level of submissiveness, but not this. She’d set her submissiveness to what had seemed to be a pretty safe level, and she hadn’t experienced anything like that at home, even when she was deep in an orgasm while reading porn. Richard was acting weird too. He had a dominance fetish, sure. But it wasn’t that strong, or he’d have acted on it before. This was wildly out of character even for the new, confident Richard.</p>
<p>And suddenly it all fell into place. Somewhere, while she’d been drunk with sexual desire, the rational part of her brain had realized something was wrong, and had been working out what. It came to her now all at once.</p>
<p>She’d turned up Richard’s sexual desire level to 65% so he’d have a great night too. His dominance level was “when aroused” so the numbers were tied together. She would bet anything that his “dominance” level — what was it, 112? She bet anything that it was higher now that his sexuality was at 65%.</p>
<p>It was the same for her submissiveness. She’d set it pretty high before she’d turned her sexuality up as well. Oh my god, she’d even made other changes too. Were they connected to submissiveness? They could be. One thing she’d learned using Master PC is that changes in one part of a person often affected things elsewhere. She’d completely screwed up the order of operations. She should have set their master sexuality first, then adjusted their dominance and submission. </p>
<p>OK, now she knew what the problem was and she had the solution. She just had to make it home and fix everything.</p>
<p>She heard a knock on the door. “Occupied,” she said.</p>
<p>The door opened. She’d been so flustered she’d forgotten to lock it. She started to say something, but it was Richard. Without asking, he let himself in.</p>
<p>“That,” he said, “was the hottest thing I’ve ever seen in my life.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Candice agreed, as she leaned on the sink, still trying to compose herself. “But now I’m just embarrassed. Let’s go home.”</p>
<p>“Not quite yet,” Richard said.</p>
<p>Candice looked up and saw the look of lust on Richard’s face. He had an almost feral grin as he stepped behind her. </p>
<p>“You couldn’t wait to get home,” he said, “and I can’t either.” He wrapped his arms around her waist and pressed up against her, and she felt his iron-hard erection through his pants digging into her lower back.</p>
<p>“Richard,” she managed, her voice a little shaky, “We can’t. Not here.”</p>
<p>But Richard wasn’t taking no for an answer. </p>
<p>“Anything I want, tonight. Remember?” he said in a low voice, his lips brushing against her ear, sending shivers down her spine. His fingers found the hem of her dress, his touch rough and possessive. The tiny bathroom suddenly felt incredibly hot. The last vestiges of her embarrassment were swiftly melting away, replaced by a potent cocktail of desire and a thrilling sense of recklessness. </p>
<p>“Oh God,” was all Candice managed as his hands slid underneath her dress, and his fingers effortlessly slid into her sopping wet pussy. She definitely hadn’t turned down the beginning of her arousal curve enough. Either that, or Richard was just that damn sexy.</p>
<p>The self-disgust she’d felt earlier was gone, replaced by a surge of raw, unadulterated lust that thrilled and terrified her in equal measure as Candice began to buck her hips against Richard’s fingers. Richard leaned down and with one hand, pulling the straps of her dress off her shoulders, exposing her breasts to the air of the small bathroom. Candice gasped, a sound swallowed by the intensifying pleasure as he continued to expertly slide his fingers in and out of her. </p>
<p>Her gaze darted to Richard’s reflection in the mirror as she started to build to a climax, and what she saw stole her breath away. His eyes, usually warm and kind, were now dark with hunger. This wasn’t the gentle, considerate lover she knew. This was a man completely in command, exuding a raw dominance that both thrilled and captivated her. His face was a mask of pure, unadulterated lust, yet there was no hint of losing control. Rather, it was a deliberate, powerful intensity. She felt a profound shift within herself, a letting go of all pretense that she still had any say in what happened next. </p>
<p>Richard quickened his pace, sliding his fingers in and out faster and faster. His other hand moved to cup her breasts, beginning to grope them roughly. Candice’s eyes remained locked on the mirror, her gaze fixed on the reflection of their intertwined bodies. She watched, mesmerized, as his hand worked her breasts. </p>
<p>“Fuck,” Richard growled, “I didn’t know you were such a slut, Candy. Is this what you like? Being fingered in a bathroom?”</p>
<p>She hated when people called her Candy. She’d always thought it was a demeaning pet name. But that was what made it sexy tonight, what put her over the top. She couldn’t form words, could only moan in response as she arched her back, her fingers clenching around the edge of the sink, knuckles white. Her gaze locked with her own reflection in the mirror, and a gasp tore from her throat as she began to cum. </p>
<p>Her vision blurred, the room spinning as waves of ecstasy crashed over her. She barely registered Richard’s hand leaving her, the shift of his weight behind her. A primal instinct, deeper than thought, took over her body, urging her to lean forward, to brace herself for what was to come. She felt the cool air against her bare buttocks, as he lifted up her dress.</p>
<p>There was no time to reorient herself, no breath to catch, no moment to process. The sound of a zipper, the sudden pressure of his throbbing erection, and then he was inside her — a powerful, rhythmic thrust that stole the air from her lungs. She gasped, a broken sound, as he drove into her from behind, each stroke pushing her further into the abyss of her own arousal.</p>
<p>“Answer me,” he said. “You play at being a strong woman, but deep down this is what you are, isn’t it? A needy slut who needs to be fucked.”</p>
<p>Candice’s eyes met her own in the mirror, and she knew Richard was right. The woman staring back at her was almost unrecognizable — the wildness in her gaze, the slightly parted mouth, the sheen of sweat on her forehead. She watched, mesmerized, as her breasts bounced with each thrust, sending a fresh wave of heat through her. Candice experienced a moment of disassociation. That wasn’t her. Candice was a smart woman, overweight with a low sex drive. The person she saw in the mirror was a beauty from a fashion magazine. No, from a high-end porn video. The woman in the mirror was Candy.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she finally answered. “I am. I’m a slut. I’m nothing but a horny slut.”</p>
<p>“Say it again,” he said. It wasn’t a request, it was a command.</p>
<p>“I’m a slut,” she said, as her eyes darted to Richard’s face, soaking in the air of command he exuded.</p>
<p>“Again.”</p>
<p>“I’m a slut!” she said loudly, looking back at her own reflection once more.</p>
<p>“Again!“</p>
<p>“I’M A SLUT!” she yelled, the unmistakable harmonics of the Command Voice echoing through the small room.</p>
<p>“That’s right you are,” he said. “My slut!“</p>
<p>Candice watched the slut in the mirror as she began to convulse, a strangled cry escaping her lips. She saw the raw, uninhibited pleasure twisting Candy’s features - no, her own features. Candy’s features. Was she Candice or Candy? She couldn’t be sure. Her gaze flickered to Richard’s in the mirror, his face a mask of triumphant satisfaction. His hips bucked once, twice, a primal groan tearing from his throat as he emptied himself deep inside her. She qit, a huge load of cum, more than he’d ever given her before.</p>
<p>Even as he came, he had an aura of power and control, staring into her face. Candice’s orgasm didn’t subside, just intensified as they locked eyes. “Yes,” she gasped as the waves of pleasure crashed over her, “This is what I want. Fill me up! Fill Candy up!“</p>
<p>Her legs buckled. She lost her balance but he held her steady as the orgasm ripped through her. When the tremors finally subsided, a breathless silence fell over the small bathroom. Candice felt a few more pulses as his erection began to soften. Richard’s breathing was still ragged, his arms still tightly wrapped around her as she watched his expression begin to change in the mirror, the dark commanding presence softening back into a more normal Richard.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe we just did that,” he said as he pulled out. Candice felt their combined juices run down her inner thigh. </p>
<p>“Yeah,” Candice agreed. </p>
<p>“Let’s get cleaned up,” Richard said.</p>
<p>Almost without thinking, Candice wiped the fluids rolling down her leg with her finger and sucked it clean. She was still pretty turned on, she realized. That was from the O-Multiplier setting on Master PC, the rational part of her mind said.</p>
<p>“Not exactly what I meant,” Richard said, raising his eyebrows. “But definitely hot.”</p>
<p>He cleaned himself off with a paper towel, zipped up his pants, then helped Candice get her dress straight. When they stepped out of the bathroom, half the patrons were looking at them. The other half were very pointedly not looking at them. A man wearing a shirt and tie was walking in their direction.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have to ask you to leave,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Richard sheepishly. “That makes sense.”</p>
<p>They were walked out of the restaurant, where Richard called an Uber to take them home. The ride back was awkward. Richard sat in silence, still processing what had just happened. Candice knew the feeling — she’d felt that way after she’d fucked Kevin on her first day with Master PC. Of course, Candice had known instantly why she’d acted so out of character. Richard didn’t, and was clearly wrestling with it.</p>
<p>Would he want to fuck her when they got home? She wasn’t sure. He looked really nervous. And she needed a good fucking. Her libido needed to be sated; she was genuinely worried what she would do if she tried to make changes to herself in her current submissive state. But she had accounted for this.</p>
<p>Her entire plan in turning her sexuality up so much was to make sure Richard gave her a night that would make her forget Kevin. She’d turned him up as well to make sure he could give her what she needed. She knew his refractory period should be pretty brief, she just needed to get him turned on again.</p>
<p>“Let us out here,” Candice said to the driver. They were only a block away from the apartment. The car pulled over and Richard got out. This time Richard didn’t walk around to open the door for Candice. She waited for a few seconds until he got the hint.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” he said, opening the door. “I’m a little distracted.” He reached down and held Candice’s hand as she got out.</p>
<p>“It’s OK, I know I don’t usually like the whole chivalry thing. But these heels and this dress makes it really hard to get out without flashing everyone.” She tried to keep it light and breezy, talk to him like a normal person and not let on how horny she still was, that all she wanted to do was drop to her knees and submit to whatever he wanted. She could tell that’s not what he needed to hear right now.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Richard said chuckling, “I could see how walking around in that would be kind of difficult. So why did we stop here?”</p>
<p>“Because you wanted a night out,” Candice said, hooking her arm around his, “and the night is still young.”</p>
<p>In point of fact, it wasn’t even really night at all yet. The last red embers of the sunset were still fading in the sky. Nearby was a trendy bar. It had those big glass garage-door type roll-ups that let them open the interior up to the street on a nice night like this. </p>
<p>“Let’s have a drink,” Candice said, and led Richard inside. It was still relatively early, so they were able to get some good seats, Richard at the bar corner with his back mostly to the street and Candice across the corner facing him. Everyone watched her as they entered, Candice noted, some more obviously than others. Richard had told her that other men looking at her was a turn-on, so she put on a show.</p>
<p>It wasn’t hard, she knew what she looked like. Slowly, she crossed her legs, her left leg fully emerging from the slit on the side of her dress, exposing her skin nearly up to her waist. She felt the warm evening breeze on her partially exposed ass. A man walking by stopped — actually stopped in his tracks. Candice caught his eye and smiled. He almost tripped over his own feet as he turned away. </p>
<p>The bartender took their orders. Richard had another whiskey sour, Candice wasn’t sure he’d touched the one at the restaurant. She ordered a martini.</p>
<p>“A dirty martini,” she specified and gave the bartender a wink. Damn, she was feeling slutty. She turned back to Richard. He was looking at her, but she couldn’t read his expression. </p>
<p>“Penny for your thoughts,” Candice prompted.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Richard said. He was quiet for a moment. “If I ask you something, do you promise to tell me the truth?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“What’s going on?”</p>
<p>Candice wasn’t sure how to answer the question.</p>
<p>“What’s going on with what?”</p>
<p>“With all this,” Richard said, his gesture encompassing the entirety of Candice. “The weight loss, the sex. Tonight. Everything.”</p>
<p>Candice wasn’t sure what to say. She looked at Richard and saw a man trying to work out a puzzle. If this were one of those mind-control stories, Candice knew this would be the part where one of the characters started questioning everything. All the little changes Candice had made to him and to herself had reached a tipping point, and Richard was realizing things weren’t normal. Candice took a big drink of her martini.</p>
<p>“I found out about the stories,” Candice said. She hadn’t planned to say it, the words just came out.</p>
<p>“What stories?” Richard asked.</p>
<p>“The, you know, the erotic ones you’ve been reading.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” Richard’s eyes widened. He looked away sheepishly, unable to meet Candice’s gaze. </p>
<p>“No, it’s fine,” Candice said, grabbing his hand.</p>
<p>“So is that what all this has been about? Fulfilling a fantasy of mine?”</p>
<p>“No! Well, yes. I’m sorry I snooped on your phone. You’d just seemed so distant lately, I didn’t want to lose you.”</p>
<p>“Candice, you’re never going to lose me.” He took a deep breath. “So you lost all this weight and decided to start acting all sexy just because you saw I’d been reading these stories?”</p>
<p>“Well,” Candice started, trying to judge how much to tell him. “It started that way. I’ve always known you liked sex more than me. And I knew I’d gained all that weight and didn’t look like I used to. So I started dieting and working out, and I started reading the stories on that site, and honestly, they were really hot.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Richard asked, surprised. “You liked them?”</p>
<p>“More than I ever thought I would,” Candice lied. “They were so hot, I kept imagining myself as one of the women being controlled and it got me really turned on. So I wanted to act it out with you, but I didn’t know how to tell you without making you feel like I was a creep for snooping on you.”</p>
<p>In truth, Candice had only found those stories hot for about the last four hours, but there was no need to tell Richard the truth about Master PC. Candice had always believed the saying “Two people can keep a secret if one of them is dead,” and she was sure whatever authorities that policed Master PC would come after them if the secret got out.</p>
<p>“So you really, legitimately, enjoyed what we just did?” he asked. He finished off his whiskey and ordered another round. Candice did the same.</p>
<p>“God yes, it was so hot. Honestly, Richard, I’m still horny and I get hornier every time I think about it. That’s why I’ve been so turned on lately, from reading the stories.”</p>
<p>Richard let out a huge sigh, like a weight had been lifted from his shoulders. </p>
<p>“OK,” he said, “so before we go any further, we should establish some ground rules.”</p>
<p>“Rules?” Candice asked. “Like what?”</p>
<p>“Like a safe word. So if I’m doing something to you or give you an order you want to say no to, I know it’s too far.” Richard’s confidence was coming back now that the mystery of the last few weeks had an explanation. And yet, his first concern was still to make sure Candice was OK. God, she really did love the guy.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if we need that,” said Candice. “I trust you.”</p>
<p>“I know, but you did say no in the bathroom, and I didn’t listen. I just… went with it. I thought you wanted it and I’m glad I read the situation right. But Candice? Just now in the car, I was terrified you were going to say I… assaulted you or something.”</p>
<p>Jesus, thought Candice. She’d been trying to give Richard the night of his life, and he’d ended up worried that he had committed rape.  </p>
<p>“OK,” she said. “A safe word. Do you have something in mind?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, a word we rarely say. Like ‘marmalade’ or something.”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Candice agreed. “Marmalade it is. Any other ground rules?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I guess I want to know what you want. What about all this gets you turned on? What are your fantasies?” Candice wasn’t sure how to answer that. Despite what she’d just told Richard, she’d masturbated to a grand total of one mind-control story ever. </p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Candice replied. “I guess I’m still trying to figure out where I want to go with it. For now it’s just the submission. You giving me an order that I obey or being on my knees in front of you. And this,” she said, gesturing around them. “Being out and everyone looking at me. I know you said it turns you on. It turns me on too. And being a slut, like you said in the bathroom when you were fucking me.”</p>
<p>Out of the corner of her eye, Candice noticed the bartender had stopped cleaning the glass he was working on. A couple other patrons had arrived and were waiting to be served, but he was too distracted eavesdropping on them. He was pretty good looking, Candice had to admit. He was one of those guys that had started to bald in their 20s, and just leaned into it by shaving his head, growing a big beard and hitting the gym. </p>
<p>Richard had noticed too. She saw him glance at the bartender, then at a few other patrons whose eyes were on Candice. It was definitely turning him on. Good, thought Candice, he needs to fuck me soon. She tapped her glass for the bartender to refill them for a second time. As he mixed her drink she took a deep breath, her breasts swelling, nearly popping out over the neckline. He dropped the shaker and had to start over. Richard gave her an approving look, and Candice giggled.</p>
<p>“What about you?” she asked Richard, after the bartender stepped away. “I know you’ve been reading them, but I don’t know exactly what parts you find the most sexy.” She realized she was waiting on his answer eagerly. She knew she would do almost anything he told her. </p>
<p>“I guess a lot of the same stuff,” he answered. “But the other way around. Being in control, having a willing… slut,” he said, using the word for the first time in normal conversation. “That’s definitely part of it. I guess the whole fantasy where she’s so turned on she just can’t say no, getting fucked stupid.” She could tell he was getting turned on talking about it. She saw a definite movement in his pants.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you said I was kind of out of it a few times tonight. Which was true, but I was wondering if part of that was you wanting me to be some dumb bimbo. Is that what you want? Me to be your dumb sexy bimbo slut, ready to serve you all the time?” Candice chewed on a bar straw in a way she knew drove guys crazy and leaned towards him, giving him a view of her chest. Just talking about all this had ratcheted up Candice’s arousal another level. Richard leaned in as well. They were turning each other on.</p>
<p>“I want you to know something,” he said after a pause. “This slut thing? This is a fantasy of mine, but it’s just a sex fantasy. I married you because you’re a strong, smart, capable woman. I love having an equal partner, being part of a team. Yes, I love this side of you. I want to really explore it with you. But I want you to know that I’d still love you and stay with you even if you said you never wanted to do this again.”</p>
<p>And just like that, Candice knew she was safe. She didn’t know how far she’d go exploring this new slutty side of herself, but she knew that when she wanted to, she could surrender to Richard’s control completely and it would be okay. That feeling of safety made her even more horny. Admittedly, it was mainly the changes she’d made to herself with Master PC, the stares of all the men in the restaurant, and the four martinis she’d had. But feeling safe with her man was a not-insignificant part of it as well.</p>
<p>“That was the most romantic thing you’ve ever said to me,” Candice said. “You need to take me back to our apartment and fuck me right now.”</p>
<p>Richard grinned. “I think I can do that.”</p>
<hr/>
<p>It was a short walk back to the apartment. Richard was all over her before the door closed. He lifted her effortlessly, carrying her through the living room and into the bedroom. Candice wrapped her legs around his waist, her arms around his neck, pressing herself against him. He didn’t bother to shut the bedroom door and gently lowered her onto the bed.</p>
<p>“Let’s get this off,” he said in a low voice, his hands fumbling with the delicate fabric of Candice’s dress. Candice’s fingers were just as eager, helping him pull it over her head and tossing it carelessly to the side. Having worn no bra or panties, she was already now completely naked.</p>
<p>She marveled at her own body for a moment. She had perfect skin, no hint of a blemish anywhere. No tan lines, no body hair. Just pale creamy flesh. She lay back and began to fondle her breasts. Even on her back, they barely sunk into her chest, retaining their shape in a way they never had before.</p>
<p>Richard wasted no time. He climbed on top of her, his weight a delicious pressure, pinning her to the bed. He leaned down, burying his face in her neck, inhaling her scent. “You’re so hot,” he murmured, his voice thick with lust. “So damn hot.”</p>
<p>His lips moved to her collarbone, trailing wet kisses lower and lower. Candice arched her back, offering herself to him. His mouth found her breast and began suckling hungrily. A moan escaped her lips, a deep, guttural sound she barely recognized as her own. Her nipples had always been sensitive, and she’d turned them up even more. She was sure she could cum just from this with a few more minutes.</p>
<p>“You want this, don’t you, slut?” he whispered, his voice a low rumble against her ear. She loved hearing the word. She was a slut now, she knew it. The thought turned her on more than anything.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Candice gasped.</p>
<p>He took off his shirt and as he did so Candice started on his pants, fumbling at his belt buckle and then freeing his erection. God, he was so hot, Candice realized. The last two weeks of tweaks on him had done wonders. His arms bulged with muscle, and he was beginning to develop a six-pack. His jaw was a little squarer, and the five o’clock shadow of his dark stubble gave him an aura of manliness any woman couldn’t help but want.</p>
<p>Soon they were both completely naked. Richard returned to sucking at her nipples, occasionally giving them little nibbles that shot a combination of pain and pleasure through her body. His hand found her pussy and began sliding his fingers in and out. Candice began to cum almost immediately, a little orgasm that rippled through her like a foreshock portending the Magnitude 10 she knew was on the horizon.</p>
<p>He pulled back just enough to look at her, his eyes filled with the same hunger she’d seen in the restaurant. He positioned himself between her legs, and Candice instinctively opened wider.</p>
<p>“Good girl,” he said, and then he was inside her, a powerful, unwavering thrust that filled her completely. Candice cried out, her breath catching in her throat as he drove into her, again and again. Each stroke was deeper, more insistent, pushing her further into the depths of her own arousal.</p>
<p>She wrapped her legs tighter around his waist, pulling him closer, desperate for more. The bed creaked under their combined weight, a rhythmic accompaniment to their escalating passion. Candice could feel herself building to another climax, a powerful, overwhelming wave of pleasure that threatened to consume her entirely. Richard’s pace quickened, his grunts echoing in the small room.</p>
<p>“Come for me, Candy,” he commanded, his voice raw with desire. “Come for your husband.”</p>
<p>And she did. Her body convulsed around him, a strangled cry tearing from her throat as waves of pure, unadulterated ecstasy washed over her. Richard thrust into her one last time, a powerful groan escaping his lips as he emptied himself deep inside her, filling her completely. He collapsed onto her, his breathing ragged, his body heavy and warm against hers.</p>
<p>“God, that was amazing,” he said. “Twice in one night. We haven’t done that in years.”</p>
<p>Candice lay there, gasping for breath, beneath him, feeling him beginning to soften inside her. Her orgasm had been intense, but it wasn’t enough. He’d cum too fast. She was still on edge, knew she needed more. </p>
<p>“Yeah,” Candice agreed. She shifted out from under him, and he rolled onto his side, his cock coming free. A little bead of cum appeared on the tip.</p>
<p>“Let me clean you up,” Candice said. And before he could answer she took his cock in her mouth. She sucked softly, reveling in the salty taste of him, dancing her tongue around the shaft. It was the most natural thing in the world, and a shiver of pure submission ran through her. This was what a slut was meant for, to pleasure a man. She felt the urge to swallow, to take him deeper.</p>
<p>“Oh god, Candice. That feels amazing, but I don’t think I can go again.” Richard’s voice was a little shaky. Candice ignored him, her focus entirely on the task at hand. Her lips moved rhythmically, her tongue swirling around him, making him moan softly. The last traces of his earlier orgasm were being replaced by a fresh surge of lust.</p>
<p>“Candy,” he groaned, his fingers tangling in her hair, not pulling away, but holding her gently in place. “We just… I just…” She felt the undeniable throb of his renewed erection against her tongue, growing thicker, hotter. He was getting hard again.</p>
<p>She pulled his cock out of her mouth, giving the head a little extra lick for good measure. </p>
<p>“Let me serve you,” she said. “Please? Let Candy serve you.”</p>
<p>Richard shook his head in amazement. “You’re such a slut,” he said. The words sent a shiver through her body. </p>
<p>“She guided him to the edge of the bed, pulled his feet off the edge and kneeled between his legs. She fished her vibrator out of the nightstand. It was a little bullet model. She’d mainly used it for her clit before, but tonight she pushed it past her lips, into her slit and turned it on. Richard watched, his eyes wide with a mixture of awe and arousal as Candice left it there, buzzing inside her and pulled his cock forward, guiding it to her breasts. She pressed it between them, rubbing it against her sensitive skin, marveling at the contrast of his hard, pulsing erection against her soft, yielding flesh.</p>
<p>Richard gasped as she began to move her tits up and down his shaft, creating a friction that she could tell drove him wild. His hands instinctively reached for her hair, holding her head gently as she continued her work. Candice looked up at him, her eyes full of lust, and saw the pure ecstasy on his face. This was her place as a slut, Candice knew.</p>
<p>“Is this what you like?” she asked rhetorically. “Do you like fucking Candy’s huge tits with your big hard cock?”</p>
<p>Richard just moaned.</p>
<p>Candice picked up her pace, her breasts moving faster against him. Richard’s hips bucked in time, a deep growl rumbling in his chest. He pushed her head down, toward her own breasts. He was so big, so hard. She licked the head of his cock each time it surfaced from the pillows of her tits. </p>
<p>She’d never given a tit-fuck before. For one thing, her breasts had only rarely been big enough, and only when she’d been overweight and self-conscious. But mainly because she’d never seen the appeal before. Old Candice would have hated every part of this. Not just the subservience, the woman giving pleasure and the man doing nothing in return. But the symbolism of it too, the woman on her knees.</p>
<p>New Candice — Candy — she loved it. In this moment, pleasing Richard was everything she wanted, and the more she pleased him the more aroused she became.</p>
<p>His breathing became ragged. She pinched her nipples, sending ripples of pleasure through herself. All the while, the vibrator inside her buzzed relentlessly, a constant hum of pleasure that kept her teetering on the edge. He was close, she could feel it. </p>
<p>Candice had a sudden stroke of inspiration. “What would you do, if you could change me?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Nothing. You’re perfect like this.” She felt his grip on her hair tighten.</p>
<p>“No,” she said. “Tell Candy. Like if I was one of those sluts in the stories. What would you do to me if you could change me however you wanted? </p>
<p>He opened his eyes, staring into hers as she bounced her tits up and down on his cock. His eyes dark with a mix of arousal and intense thought. “If I could change you… I’d make you the biggest slut in the world, Candy. You’d wear the sluttiest clothes, showing off your round ass and fat tits, always begging for more.”</p>
<p>Candice saw it all in her mind’s eye: a new version of herself, dressed in a tubetop that stretched across her chest and mini-skirt that barely covered her pussy. Her round ass and full breasts were constantly on display. She saw herself with an insatiable hunger, always pleading for more, always ready for a man’s cock.</p>
<p>“Mmm, and I could be blonde,” Candy said. “Sluts like me are always blonde in the stories.”</p>
<p>He tightened his grip on her hair again, pulling her head slightly further back. “Yeah. You’d look hot as a blonde. Every man would look at you and you’d love every second of it. You’d live to serve, to spread your legs, and show off your perfect body.”</p>
<p>“Then that’s what I’ll be for you,” she purred, her voice husky with desire. “I’ll be your slut, your bimbo. I’m yours, Richard. Candy is your slut. Use me, Richard. Empty your big, hard cock all over Candy’s soft tits. Candy needs it so bad!“</p>
<p>That sent him over the edge. Richard came, jets of cum spurting into the air. Knowing she’d served her man, Candy came as well, the vibrator still buzzing inside her, sending exquisite shivers through her pussy. Richard’s hot cum splattered across her breasts, some hitting her face in a warm, sticky cascade and Candy loved it. The combined sensations were overwhelming, pushing her deeper into a relentless, all-consuming orgasm.</p>
<p>Finally, when the last of the orgasm subsided, Candice knew she was fully sated. She pulled the vibrator out, set it aside, and then began to lick the cum off her breasts. She used her finger to collect what she couldn’t reach with her tongue and sucked it down as well. It tasted terrible, but that didn’t matter to her right now, she knew Richard would want it.</p>
<p>“Mmmmm,” she moaned. “Thank you. Thank you for giving Candy your hot cum.” She was still coming down from the orgasm, her submission beginning to fade, but she wanted to hold onto it a little bit longer, it felt so good.</p>
<p>“Thank you…” she paused, unsure what to say next. “Hmm, saying ‘Thank you Richard’ doesn’t sound right,” Candice purred as she climbed up into bed with him, laying next to her spent man. “Candice calls you Richard. What do you want me to call you when I’m Candy?”</p>
<p>Richard smiled.</p>

<h2 id="part-5-officially-a-slut">Part 5: Officially a Slut</h2>
<p>It was official: Candice was a slut.</p>
<p>One thing she liked about Master PC was that it boiled everything down to a number. Couples might have cute little arguments. “I love you more.” “No, I love you more.”</p>
<p>But if you had Master PC, you knew. Richard loved Candice four points more than she loved him. It was right there. By the same logic, Candice was a slut. Sluttiness was one of the major sexual controls, right under the Master Sexuality slider. She was pretty sure her number was zero yesterday, but today she was 58-points slutty, whatever that meant. </p>
<p>So she was a slut now. She let the idea roll around in her head. She didn’t hate it.</p>
<p>Candice was pretty sure she knew what had happened. When Richard had been fucking her at the restaurant, she’d felt the Command Voice come out when she’d screamed “I’M A SLUT!” into the mirror. Normally the Voice didn’t affect the person using it. She’d said “IGNORE THAT LAPTOP” plenty of times at work and she could still see it fine. But looking at herself in the mirror, she had directed the Voice back onto herself.</p>
<p>She wondered, not for the first time, how “sticky” changes made with Master PC were. Take something non-sexual like rollercoasters, for example. Imagine someone was scared of them, but Master PC had a “loves rollercoasters” slider. If you set that up high and stuck them on a rollercoaster they’d have a ton of fun. What would happen if you set that number back down later? They would still have fond memories of riding the rollercoaster, and might want to get on it again. Would they enjoy it because they’d already had fun on it once, and wouldn’t be scared of it anymore?</p>
<p>By the same token, Candice’s exhibitionism was pretty high now, according to Master PC. Was that because she’d done it last night when she wanted to please Richard, and now it was just something that turned her on in general because it had been fun once? Or possibly she’d always had some latent exhibitionism that had never manifested when she was 30% sexual. </p>
<p>So many questions.</p>
<p>Candice pondered them as she sat curled up on the couch with her morning tea and her laptop open. It was late Saturday morning, the day after her wild night of submission, and she was still figuring out what to do next. No matter what she decided, she knew her life was changed forever.</p>
<p>Richard was in the building’s gym downstairs. He’d kissed her when they’d woken up, ready for another round. She’d turned him down. It had been hard, but she’d had to prove to herself that she could. It turned out she’d set her arousal curve correctly. She could hit an incredibly orgasmic high (“Kevin who?” she joked to herself) with a much slower buildup. But yesterday she’d spent the hour before Richard got home masturbating to mind control porn and anticipating what they were going to do together. Of course she’d been ready to go when she saw him. </p>
<p>In fact, in many ways last night had gone perfectly. Her plan had worked, despite the curveball of Richard taking her out to eat. They’d had amazing sex, and she’d been the perfect little submissive slut for her husband, fulfilling his long-held fantasy. And yet, here she was this morning, not feeling particularly submissive at all. The magic of “when aroused” in Master PC was working fine. Candice congratulated herself on her accomplishment. She really felt like she was beginning to understand how to use Master PC. </p>
<p>And with her newfound confidence, she was rethinking the second part of her plan. She had been going to reset herself and Richard back to 55%, but could they just stay at this heightened sexuality permanently? Candice had to admit, last night was fun, and the orgasms were almost addictively mind-blowing. </p>
<p>This morning, before Richard had left for the gym, when he was still horny and ready to go, she’d asked him if he had really meant what he’d said last night, that he wanted her as a strong independent woman. He’d said yes, and she knew he was telling the truth because she’d been watching the icons flashing on his mental state readout. She had gotten pretty good at reading them.</p>
<p>It opened up a whole new world of possibilities. If he’d lied then, or changed his mind, she’d have reverted herself right then and there. Maybe even dropped his dominance. The submission was terrifying in a way. Last night, if he’d told her to change herself permanently, she knew she would have done it. But now she knew she could explore this submission as much as she wanted. Even at her most submissive, she wouldn’t change herself into a bimbo permanently because it wasn’t what he really wanted.</p>
<p>Perhaps, thought Candice, she could use the weekend to experiment and figure out where she wanted to leave their settings on a long-term basis. She had to prove one more thing to herself first, though. She turned her Sluttiness down to 0 and clicked Apply.</p>
<p>Suddenly, deep shame washed over her. She felt aghast at how she’d been kicked out of a fancy restaurant, how far she’d let Richard take it. It wasn’t pleasant, but she forced herself to examine her feelings. Did she want to turn it back up?</p>
<p>It was like the rollercoaster example. If she hated rollercoasters, and turned up her love of them so she could ride them with Richard, that wouldn’t be bad. Was sex or sluttiness any different, ethically? It felt like it was, somehow, but she couldn’t put a finger on why. She was making these changes to herself, of her own free will. There was nothing wrong with that. And nothing wrong with being a slut, either, she told herself. She’d always said women shouldn’t slut-shame each other. That went double, she figured, for slut-shaming herself. Plus, despite feeling a little disgusted at herself for kneeling before her man last night, it had also been one of the best experiences of her life. </p>
<p>She turned her sluttiness back up to 58. No, she thought, let’s make it a nice round 60. Just to prove to herself it was her own choice. She clicked Apply.</p>
<p>The shame vanished, replaced with arousal, and an anticipation of doing it again. It felt right. She was a slut now, after all. Or at least this version of her was, and this was the version she’d made herself into.</p>
<p>Speaking of sluts, something in Master PC caught her eye. Candice still had Richard’s profile pulled up as well, and had been keeping an eye on him at the gym. Now a girl was approaching him. Candice didn’t normally spy on Richard this much, but she wanted to make sure he could stay loyal to her even at 65%. The only thing Candice had changed about him since last night was increasing his refractory period to something more normal. It was still a lot shorter than most guys, but she knew if Richard was getting hard every hour he’d figure out something weird was going on pretty quick.</p>
<p>The girl was young and pretty, with dirty blonde hair and a decent pair of tits. Candice turned on the sound. </p>
<p>When she’d first started using Master PC, it had just shown a person’s naked avatar in a white empty space. But of course Master PC had a seemingly infinite number of controls and options. She’d figured out how to switch to a camera view last week. Now she saw the full gym, heard the sound of weights being lifted through the laptop speakers. It was like a third-person view in a videogame. The “camera” was locked on Richard, but she could spin it around and see what was happening nearby.</p>
<p>The girl was asking him for help with some of the gym equipment. She was wearing tight yoga pants and a sports bra with nothing over it. Candice made a note to buy an outfit like that for herself. </p>
<p>“Move along,” Candice said out loud to the girl on screen, but didn’t actually make any changes. She wanted to see how this played out. Richard did help her with the equipment, showing her how to use one of the arm exercise machines. The girl began chatting him up. Candice didn’t need Master PC to know she was attracted to Richard. She kept touching her hair occasionally, laughing at what he said even when it wasn’t a joke. </p>
<p>Candice double-clicked on her, shifting Master PC’s focus. Candice saw her name appear on the screen overlay. It was one of those godawful misspellings, Paezleigh. And she was only 19! Richard was more than 12 years her senior! Come on girl, Candice thought, I know you see the wedding ring.</p>
<p>Finally, she offered her number to Richard. Candice held her breath, watching intently. He said no! Candice pumped her fist in the air. Suck it, Paezleigh! Well, actually, you can’t. I’m going to be the one sucking it today!</p>
<p>She watched as Richard got up and went to the bathroom. And was he? Yes. He was masturbating in the stall. Candice watched with a voyeuristic thrill. Suddenly, she wished she was there with him, ready to satisfy his urges. She pressed her legs together tightly, loving the pressure it put on her clit. </p>
<p>If this weekend was going to be experimenting with Master PC, Candice thought, she should get started while Richard was gone. She felt like she’d made enough psychological changes to herself for now, but a few more physical ones could be fun.</p>
<p>First things first, time to go blonde. She pulled up the hair colors and browsed through all the different shades of fair hair that Master PC offered. She first tried some of the lighter shades, but she just couldn’t see herself as a Platinum Blonde. In the end, she settled on Light Blonde, retaining some of the lowlights of her own darker hair color. She liked the way the blonde hair looked on her, it definitely added to the “light, flirty” look a slut like her should be going for. She debated heavily about leaving her eyebrows dark. On one hand, leaving her eyebrows dark gave her a “bottle blonde” look that definitely fit, but she really dug the natural look of “blonde everywhere” too. In the end she split the difference and brightened her eyebrows up a few shades while leaving them a bit darker than her hair.</p>
<p>Now she needed to do something about her body hair. Normally she kept a trimmed bush. Shaving every day was a lot of work, and Richard complained about the stubble if she let it go. She could make the carpet match the drapes, but of course “no body hair” was a very prominent checkbox for Master PC. She checked it.</p>
<p>On to clothes. There actually was a clothing tab. That had surprised Candice at first. Everything else in Master PC was about changing a person, not a thing. You could use it to alter a person’s weight, sexual orientation, ethnicity, almost anything. But you couldn’t change the color of your couch or the size of your coffee mug.</p>
<p>But it made sense once you realized Master PC was made for sex, and part of the “instant bimbo” fantasy had to include clothing. So of course it was there. Weirdly enough, nearly all the clothes it had pre-loaded were wildly out of fashion. Most of the clothing selections looked like something from the 90s or early 2000s. The lingerie was especially lacy and frilly and had an outsized selection of stockings and garter belts.</p>
<p>Of course, Master PC offered unlimited customization. If Candice was any good at 3D Modeling, she could have made herself just about any outfit imaginable. But honestly that sounded like more work than just shopping. The big use she saw for the clothing in Master PC was that she could resize her wardrobe. At least anything Candice ordered online could always be fitted perfectly. </p>
<p>Candice decided to google “Slut” to get some outfit inspirations. The top result caught her eye. It was just the definition.</p>
<p>&gt; slut (n) a woman who has many casual sexual partners.</p>
<p>Candice chuckled. It was funny, before Master PC she’d only ever had two sexual partners: an old high school boyfriend and Richard. Then a couple weeks ago, she’d fucked Kevin, the Abercrombie &amp; Fitch sales associate. But at that point she’d been under the influence of Master PC, so he hardly counted. But even including him, she’d still only slept with three men ever. She must be one of the least promiscuous sluts alive, she thought.</p>
<p>OK, back to looking for outfit inspiration. She clicked over to the image results and found mostly porn. She changed her search to “slutty outfits” and saw a plethora of sexy and revealing clothes. Candice knew she wouldn’t be able to get many of those outfits in the local clothing boutiques, so she ordered at least a dozen great outfits online. With Master PC, she was sure she could make them fit perfectly.</p>
<p>But she still needed something to wear today. She got up and put on the skirt she’d been planning to wear last night, before Richard had made her change into the dress. After it appeared on her avatar, she grabbed the resizing tool and made it a few inches shorter. She didn’t have a great top to go with it, but tube tops never went out of style, so she found one of those in Master PC. The default color was a super saturated Barbie-pink. She changed it to a pure white, and then changed the color on the skirt to match. She gave herself a pair of white platform heels to complete the look. She clicked Apply.</p>
<p>She watched as her skirt shortened and her t-shirt morphed, shrinking and changing color. She hadn’t been wearing any shoes, but her socks morphed into the heels, becoming hard plastic. It was very cool to watch, like some kind of movie special effect. </p>
<p>One more change, she decided. She had been cautious with Master PC ever since that first day, but considering how well things had gone last night, she had the confidence to try a few more of the outrageous things that had caught her eye. She went back to the Secondary Control options. The Command Voice had been one of the most useful things she’d used so far, there had to be some more stuff in there. She scrolled through the other options. Animal Magnetism? Didn’t need it, her current looks did that for her already. Commanding Presence? Interesting thought, but it didn’t fit with the submissive slutty vibe she had going. Vampirism? Why would you even want that? You could get the mind control and eternal youth from Master PC without the downsides. </p>
<p>There was a whole section called “Fluids” that had a ton of options. She could give herself permanently lactating breasts, and make either that milk or her pussy juices have any kind of hypnotic, mind-controlling, or body-altering effects. She didn’t want any of that, but an option under saliva caught her eye. She could make any man instantly hard by sucking on his cock. That was perfect. She could keep Richard’s refractory period normal, but use this power to get him up again if he finished before she was done. She selected that. </p>
<p>Speaking of which, she could also make his cum taste good. She thought about that, but wondered if he would notice. Would it change the smell if he masturbated? Better not, when she could just make herself enjoy the taste. Same difference, really.</p>
<p>But she was really looking for something more utilitarian. Something like the Command Voice that was useful outside of sex. Then she found an interesting option: Mind Reading. That looked neat. She could imagine all sorts of possibilities there. She turned it on and clicked Apply again.</p>
<p>That should do it for changes, she decided. Candice walked over to the mirror and admired herself. In some ways she looked much as she had last night at the restaurant. She still had flawless skin, a great ass, and a killer rack. But last night, with her dark brown hair and sexy but stylish dress, she’d looked like an expensive escort or a celebrity on the red carpet. Now she looked… kind of trashy. The blonde hair, the tube top. It was definitely a look. A slutty look. Candice liked it.</p>
<p>As she admired herself, she noticed how her tits almost seemed to defy gravity. Did they look fake, like she’d had a boob job? Or were they passable as natural? And, now that she thought of it, when had she started to think of them as tits? Candice had always called them breasts, or maybe “boobs” if she was feeling sexy. They’d never been tits to her before. It must be the sluttiness, she thought.</p>
<p>Just looking at herself in the mirror turned her on. She imagined herself kneeling before Richard as her new blonde self, dressed like a trashy slut. It made her wet just thinking about it.</p>
<p>She wanted to do it now, wanted to text him to come up right away and let her suck his cock. But no. She needed time to make him think she’d dyed her hair. She needed to leave the apartment for a while and come back later. Which was fine, she needed to do some more clothes shopping for her new figure. But she just wanted him so bad right now.</p>
<p>She probably shouldn’t go out like this, she reasoned. She had felt like she was in control of her libido all morning, but watching Richard masturbate, and then making the changes to herself had really made her horny again. It wasn’t too bad — she wasn’t in danger of “doing a Kevin” right now, but better safe than sorry. </p>
<p>She headed to her bedroom and pulled her vibrator out of the nightstand. Before last night it hadn’t been used in several months, but Candice felt like it was going to be used a lot more in the future. She reclined on the bed and turned it on. </p>
<p>As the vibrations hummed against her clit, Candice closed her eyes and let her mind wander. The pleasure built, a warm wave spreading through her. She imagined Richard, strong and commanding, looking down at her, her new blonde hair spread around her head like a halo. She saw herself on her knees, eager to please him, to fulfill his every desire. The thought of being completely his, a submissive slut at his beck and call, sent shivers of excitement through her.</p>
<p>“Yes, Daddy,” she whispered to herself, the word feeling surprisingly natural on her lips. It was what Richard had asked to be called last night. Old Candice used to cringe when she heard women call their man “Daddy.” She had thought it was some kind of incestuous fetish, gross and wrong. But now she understood. It wasn’t about family; it was about power. About submission. About being a little girl who didn’t make decisions on her own and who was completely at the mercy of the man who commanded her. It made her feel small and vulnerable, and she loved it.</p>
<p>She imagined him calling her “good girl,” his voice deep and approving. She wanted to be Daddy’s good girl, to serve him, to make him proud of her transformation. The vibrator pressed harder, mirroring the intensity of her growing fantasy. She moaned softly, a delicious tension building in her core as she pressed the vibrator against her clit. She was ready. Ready for Daddy.</p>
<p>A little part of the old her recoiled. She couldn’t do this. It was one thing to play at being submissive with Richard. It was another thing to make him her Daddy. But the voice was small, and drowned out as her orgasm crested, a gentle shiver rippling through her body, a small, teasing release that left her aching for a deeper, more profound surrender. It was enough to whet her appetite, to remind her of the incredible pleasure she was capable of, but not enough to truly satisfy the craving that now consumed her. She needed Richard, needed her Daddy, to fully claim her.</p>
<p>There was one more thing her Daddy wanted that he’d mentioned last night. One more thing she’d been avoiding. She pushed the vibrator inside her, leaving it on the lowest setting. A gentle buzz that left her perpetually near the edge.</p>
<p>She grabbed the laptop and browsed back through Master PC. She couldn’t find exactly what she wanted at first. There was, of course, an option for “bimbofication” but it included body changes, and she’d done enough of that for now. She dove into the documentation. And after a few text searches found what she was looking for.</p>
<p>Temporary Sex-related intelligence drain is surprisingly difficult for such a common fantasy. There is no default option for this in Master PC. The closest option is to use Arousal-Induced Bimbofication with the associated physical changes disabled. However, bimbofication includes an increase in sexuality, and if the woman in question has already had her sexuality increased this may not be desirable. There is no single control for simple ‘dumbification.’</p>
<p>However, I have developed the following method. First, browse to the Mental tab…</p>
<p>Candice was beginning to develop the theory that the documentation was written not by the creator of Master PC, but by users who had written out their findings before passing the program on to someone else. Now she was benefiting from their wisdom — not to change another woman against her will, as the author had undoubtedly intended, but to change herself.</p>
<p>She followed the instructions as written to the best of her ability. She set new values for many of her intelligence-related traits, but instead of clicking Apply immediately, she right-clicked the new value and tied it to a floating O-Satiation variable defined on the sexuality tab. The vibrator buzzing away inside her made it more difficult, but she also knew she wouldn’t have the courage to do this without it.</p>
<p>The worst case scenario, she knew, would be that she would make herself permanently dumb. But even if she did, she knew she had safety nets. For one, she had saved her current values and could revert to them at any time (in fact, it turned out Master PC had saved her “base state” and she could fully revert back to that if she needed to). Even a much dumber version of herself should be able to load the saved values. And if worse came to worse, Daddy would realize something was wrong if Candice became permanently dumb. She would have to tell him about Master PC, but he would be able to figure it out. Daddy was her ultimate safety net. She knew he didn’t want a permanently dumb wife and would fix her if needed.</p>
<p>She hovered the mouse pointer over the Apply button, closed her eyes, and clicked it.</p>
<p>Candy came, immediately. Before she even felt the changes, before she could even process what she had done. Just knowing that she had made herself into exactly what Daddy wanted did it for her. Her mind went blissfully blank, the complicated thoughts and calculations of Master PC, the ethical dilemmas, the safety nets — all of it dissolved into a warm, buzzing haze. It was as if a switch had been flipped, silencing the incessant chatter in her brain. All that remained was the pure, unadulterated sensation of the vibrator, a delicious hum that now resonated through her entire being. Her body arched, a soft cry escaping her lips as the waves of pleasure intensified, washing over her, leaving her utterly empty and filled all at once. This was what Daddy wanted. This was good. This was perfect. She was perfect. The perfect slut for Daddy.</p>

<h2 id="part-6-a-little-push">Part 6: A Little Push</h2>
<p>Candice was still in bed when her phone buzzed. She was enjoying the feeling of an empty mind. She’d taken yoga classes at one point, tried to work on letting go of all her cares and worries, but meditation had never really worked for her. If only I’d had Master PC back then, she thought. It was like a shortcut to zen. Her mind was coming back to her now. It had been at least 15 minutes since her orgasm and she felt mostly normal. Maybe a little slow, a little duller than normal. But that could also be because she still had a finger in her pussy, enjoying the delicious afterglow.</p>
<p>She checked her phone.</p>
<p>&gt; Hey, just finished my workout. On the way up. You need anything?</p>
<p>Shit! She had to get out of here! There hadn’t been nearly enough time to dye her hair! Fortunately, she was still wearing the skirt, tube top, and platform heels she’d made with Master PC. She grabbed her purse, ran out of the apartment, and ducked into the emergency stairwell. It was 12 stories down their apartment building, but she couldn’t risk running into Richard on the elevators. She navigated her way down the stairs as best she could in her ridiculous heels. </p>
<p>On the way down, she passed a man taking the stairs up. He stopped in his tracks as she walked by. Her skirt was so short, she was pretty sure he’d gotten a glance at her pussy. The thought turned her on.</p>
<p>As soon as she got out of the building, she sent Daddy a text back.</p>
<p>&gt; I left to grab some new outfits and some other stuff. Be back a little later with a surprise 💖</p>
<p>She left her apartment building behind, heading deeper into downtown. There were some nice clothing boutiques just a few blocks away, so she decided to walk. She wanted to get out, for people to see the new her.</p>
<p>The air was already turning warm, and Candice felt the breeze on her exposed skin, a stark contrast to the frumpy clothes she usually wore. Each click of her platform heels against the pavement felt like a punctuation mark in her transformation. She swung her hips a little more, her outfit and figure drawing gazes. This was what she wanted: to be seen, to be admired, to embrace the attention that her new persona seemed to effortlessly command. </p>
<p>To Candice, everything seemed to hum with an almost palpable sexual electricity, a vibrant current that made her skin tingle. Every gaze from a passerby, every quick double-take, felt like a caress, igniting a slow burn within her. She caught the eye of a man in a crisp suit, his expression subtly shifting from professional detachment to concealed admiration.</p>
<p>Driven by a sudden curiosity, Candice opened her mind, focusing her new power outward, letting the thoughts and feelings of the men around her wash over her. The effect was immediate and almost overwhelming. A wave of raw, unfiltered arousal crashed into her, a chorus of desires and fantasies. She felt their eyes tracing her curves, their minds conjuring scenarios she hadn’t even consciously considered. It wasn’t just admiration; it was a potent, collective hum of sexual energy. She was a beacon, drawing them in, and the sheer volume of their desire made her own arousal swell. She felt herself getting horny in return and had to shut the door to her mind. Still, the sensation lingered with her and the feeling of being watched was delicious.</p>
<p>She felt bubbly, airy. On a whim, she whipped out her phone and took a selfie of herself. She hadn’t used Instagram in a while, but wasn’t that what girls like her did? She posted it with the caption “Feeling cute today.”</p>
<p>The next few hours were a blur of boutiques and thrift stores. Shopping for casual wear was easy. She found a few crop tops, denim short-shorts and whatever slutty clothes she thought Richard would love while she waited for the clothes she’d bought online to be delivered. </p>
<p>Shopping for work, however, was a whole different story. Since she’d dropped all the weight, most of her office clothes didn’t really fit anymore. Candice tried to find a mix of professional and “sexy,” with an emphasis on “professional.” She wasn’t going to be one of those characters in the stories who end up wearing micro-skirts to the office. She was still looking to get that promotion, and she knew she needed to look snappy and smart. Still, being attractive never hurt anyone’s career advancement, so she made sure the outfits looked good. She found a pencil skirt that hugged her hips just right and a few blouses with necklines a little lower than she’d have considered wearing to the office before, but nothing too crazy.</p>
<p>Her next stop was an “intimates” store. She bought a few sexy bits of lingerie — some red panties and the like, but frilly stuff wasn’t really her style. She mostly wanted to get some new toys. All she had at home was a lonely bullet vibrator. She picked out a variety of new gadgets. Several dildos of various sizes. Some that vibrated, others that didn’t. Lastly, she grabbed a vibrator that was meant to be worn underneath your clothes that could be remote-controlled. The idea of Daddy using it, making it vibrate away inside her while they were out in public somewhere made her wet instantly. On a whim, she added a set of delicate, silver nipple clamps to her basket, imagining the exquisite sensation of Richard tugging on them.</p>
<p>After putting over a grand on her credit card between the clothes and toys, she decided to head home. She couldn’t wait to show Daddy what she’d bought.</p>
<p>On the way back, she passed a nail salon and looked at her own hands. She had made her nails stronger and glossier with Master PC, but she felt someone with her look would have more going on. On a whim, she stepped inside. </p>
<p>The interior was bright and airy, with soft lighting and the sweet, slightly acrid scent of polish in the air. Several women were seated in comfortable, plush chairs, their hands or feet soaking in bubbling basins. Soft jazz played from unseen speakers, creating a relaxing ambiance. A wall of colorful polish bottles shimmered under the lights, offering a dizzying array of choices. This really wasn’t Candice’s normal thing. She usually just painted her nails at home, and really only for special occasions. She hesitated at the door until one of the girls working there saw her and walked to the counter.</p>
<p>“Do you have an appointment?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Uh, no,” Candice answered.</p>
<p>The girl frowned and scrolled through her appointments on her computer. She was young, maybe mid-20s, but looked very tired considering it wasn’t even noon yet. She wore a plain black t-shirt, and had faded blue hair, the black roots showing prominently. A nose ring pierced her septum, and she had a little butterfly tattoo on her neck. Her short nails were a dark, shiny black. </p>
<p>Candice decided to try the mind reading power again. It had felt overwhelming earlier, when she’d thrown the door open and felt the lust of all those men on the street. This time she was more careful. She could feel the power there, like a new muscle she could move if she willed it. She gave it an experimental flex, stretching it out toward the girl.</p>
<p>Candice felt the girl’s disdain for her “basic blonde” look, a hint of judgment for her revealing outfit, but an even stronger envy for Candice’s perfect figure and an undercurrent of attraction. Candice didn’t hear words, exactly, but somehow knew the girl was considering if she wanted to give Candice her open 2:00 slot or just use that time to take a break.</p>
<p>“GIVE ME THE NEXT SLOT,” Candice told her using the Command Voice. “BUMP EVERYONE ELSE BACK.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I think I can fit you in,” the girl said with the slightly dazed expression she’d become familiar with when she hit someone with the Voice. “What do you want done?”</p>
<p>“I don’t really know. I was thinking long acrylic nails and probably something for my feet too.”</p>
<p>“Sure,” the girl said. “I’m just finishing up with my current customer now. You’re next.”</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, Candice was being settled into a plush chair.</p>
<p>“I’m River,” the blue-haired girl said, “and I’ll be taking care of you today.”</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you, River,” Candice replied. “I’m…” Candice hesitated a moment. “I’m Candy,” she finished. Why not try out the new name, she thought. Just going by her “slut name” made her a little horny. Candice could see her own nipples, a little hard beneath her thin tube top. River could see them too, and Candice caught her taking more than a few glances as she began to examine Candice’s feet.</p>
<p>“So what brings you in today?” River said, making small talk.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ve actually been losing weight and trying out a new look to go along with it. To be honest, I’ve never actually had a pedicure, and the last time I had my nails done was senior prom.”</p>
<p>River raised an eyebrow, a hint of surprise in her expression. “Really? Well, there’s a first time for everything, right? You’re doing great, though. The new look definitely suits you.”</p>
<p>River started by soaking her feet in some sort of blue liquid while she began work on her nails. </p>
<p>Candice watched River’s hands as she meticulously filed and buffed. The woman was good, very precise. It wasn’t really something she needed to go to a salon for, of course. Using Master PC, Candice could have just given herself perfect nails. But there was something satisfying about the tactile experience, the pampering. It felt more real, somehow, when it was done by another person.</p>
<p>“Alright, Candy, what kind of shape and length are you thinking?” River pulled out a tray of colorful acrylic powders and a box of various nail tips.</p>
<p>Candice leaned forward, examining the options. “White. Pure white. And I want them really long. And I’m thinking sharp, pointy on the end.”</p>
<p>River nodded. “Long and sharp it is.” She began the meticulous process, applying the tips and then building up the acrylic. Candice watched, fascinated, as her short, practical nails transformed into slender, sharply edged talons. They were completely impractical, she knew. She’d probably struggle to type on her laptop, and simple tasks like buttoning a shirt or opening a can of soda would become a hilarious challenge. But that was precisely the point.</p>
<p>These nails felt incredibly feminine, almost impossibly so. They were a clear signal that she was embracing a side of herself that had been dormant for too long—the playful, slightly over-the-top, unapologetically girly side. She imagined trying to pick up a dropped coin with them, or fumbling with her car keys. It made her smile. She’d have to rely on Richard for little things now, leaning into his help. And she knew, with a certainty that hummed through her new slutty self, that he would absolutely love it.</p>
<p>As River worked on her nails, Candice kept hearing her phone buzz. Finally, she pulled it out and checked what all the notifications were. Her Instagram was blowing up. The selfie she’d posted earlier had more likes and comments than anything she’d ever posted. She checked the comments. The top one was from her best friend Mia.</p>
<p>&gt; lol what did you use to make this?</p>
<p>Candice was vaguely annoyed. Mia thought it was a joke post. In fact, several of her friends seemed to think she was making fun of Instagram influencers with an AI image of herself. Well, that was a kind of compliment, she figured, if they thought she was so pretty she must be AI. A bunch of guys she’d never met had also left comments, and she had several dick pics in her DMs. A couple of them were actually pretty hot.</p>
<p>Candice turned her attention back to River, who was applying the final clear top coat, her movements fluid and precise. The nails shimmered under the salon lights.</p>
<p>Then she began to work on her feet. They continued making small talk, with Candice reading River’s mind as she went. It was fun, experimenting with this new power. She couldn’t really delve into River’s psyche and pull up her deep thoughts or anything, just read surface-level emotions and impressions. But she did detect a current of depression in the girl. It was striking. On the surface, River was friendly and bright, but Candice could tell it was a thin facade she wore with a practiced ease.</p>
<p>“I like your nails,” Candice said. “The black isn’t my style, but they really suit you.”</p>
<p>“Thanks. Yeah, they’re pretty much my default. Easy to maintain.”</p>
<p>“Do you ever make them more elaborate?”</p>
<p>River chuckled, not looking up from Candice’s foot. “Not as often as I’d like. It’s the Cobbler’s Children Syndrome, right? I’m so busy making everyone else look good, I neglect myself. When I do nails for eight hours a day, I just don’t feel like doing it for myself when I get home.” </p>
<p>Candice read her thoughts as she talked, and she felt like River didn’t really like “home.” She sensed a messy apartment, a boyfriend she was going through the motions with. And a sense of resignation to it all. Candice could almost see it, the feeling was so clear.</p>
<p>“Does your boyfriend like them that way?” Candice asked.</p>
<p>River frowned. “He doesn’t really care, to be honest.”</p>
<p>“Ah, boy trouble,” Candice said. “I knew it!“</p>
<p>“Is it that obvious?” River grimaced for a moment, but it was quickly replaced with a joking smile. A “you know how it is, between us girls” kind of look. She didn’t want to show how she was really feeling in front of a customer.</p>
<p>“Not too obvious, I’m just very… perceptive,” Candice answered. “The wrinkled clothes, the faded hair dye. You don’t look like you have someone to impress at home.”</p>
<p>“Well, I shouldn’t have to, right? If I’m in a relationship, the guy should be comfortable with the real me.”</p>
<p>“Oh, River,” Candice said. “No! I used to think that way, but being in a relationship means trying to be the best person you can be for your partner!“</p>
<p>“I guess,” River said, not wanting to argue with a customer.</p>
<p>“Look at you,” Candice continued, “You’re beautiful, River. You have great style, even if it’s not mine. But you’re settling. You’re letting yourself fade out when you should be shining! Or smoldering. Or whatever the right superlative is for your style!“</p>
<p>River laughed, genuinely, as Candice continued.</p>
<p>“Why are you wearing a plain black t-shirt when you could be showing off that cute figure? Why let your roots show? You know how to make people look amazing. Why aren’t you applying that effort to yourself, for the person who supposedly loves you? Or for yourself?” Candice heard her own voice ring with a conviction she hadn’t known she possessed. But she knew she was right. She thought about how she and Richard’s relationship had also been stuck in a rut recently. She thought about how great things had been for the past week, and especially last night. Candice knew now that true happiness in a relationship came when you made yourself into what your partner wanted. She thought about Daddy, how she couldn’t wait to get home and kneel in front of him. River needed that in her life.</p>
<p>River pulled her hands out of the water, resting them on the side of the basin, her earlier joking expression completely gone. Her eyes met Candice’s, a mix of hurt and defensiveness flashing in them. “It’s not that simple, Candy. I’m exhausted. I work hard—”</p>
<p>“I had the same excuses,” Candice cut in, her tone hardening. She leaned closer, projecting the Command Voice at the tired girl. “YOU ARE GOING TO START TRYING HARDER. YOU ARE GOING TO EMBRACE YOUR FEMININITY AND YOU ARE GOING TO BE SEXY. REFRESH YOUR HAIR DYE AND LEAN INTO THE ALT-GIRL LOOK. GET SOME CUTE OUTFITS.”</p>
<p>The words struck River with physical force. Her eyes glazed over for a moment, her breath hitching. When she spoke again, her voice was quiet, full of newfound resolve. “You’re right. I… I have been letting myself go. I know I’m capable of more.”</p>
<p>“Good girl,” Candice said.</p>
<p>“Now I just need my boyfriend to start trying too,” River joked as she went back to work on massaging and exfoliating Candice’s feet.</p>
<p>But Candice knew it wasn’t a joke. Well, she could fix that too. She could tweak the boyfriend, make their relationship better the same way she’d changed Richard.</p>
<p>It was exactly the kind of thing Candice had initially told herself she wouldn’t do: make changes to other people without their consent or knowledge. At first, she’d made some little changes to Richard, things she knew he’d want. She’d told herself that was different because she knew him so well, knew what he’d say yes to if only she asked. But those changes had gotten bigger without her really realizing it, hadn’t they? She’d kept ratcheting up his self-confidence until his demeanor had changed, and his sexuality was certainly much higher than it was in the beginning. </p>
<p>But those had worked out, hadn’t they? And how unethical could it really be to help people? Help them be better? In fact, if she could change someone else for the better, didn’t she have the responsibility to do that? Wasn’t that what they always said in the Spider-Man movies? With great power comes the responsibility to use it, or something like that? Considering she basically had super-powers now, shouldn’t she be helping people as much as she could?</p>
<p>“Do me a favor,” Candice said. “Picture your ideal partner and tell me what you see.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know…” River began.</p>
<p>“TRUST ME,” Candice said. “I’m a relationship expert.”</p>
<p>“Alright,” the nail tech said.</p>
<p>Candice focused, reaching out with her mind, zeroing in on the visualization River was attempting to form. Candice couldn’t see it herself, but she got impressions from River’s mind. It was a kaleidoscope of traits: strong hands, an understanding gaze, a powerful but kind demeanor. But then, something wavered, and for a moment it felt like River was picturing a woman. Soft, curvy, alluring. It was an intense jolt of pure, hot curiosity. The impression was clear: River was bisexual, or at least intensely bi-curious, and had clearly never acted on it. </p>
<p>Candice forgot about changing the boyfriend. This was much more interesting. A smile spread across her lips. “Tell me about them,” she prompted, her voice a low, throaty purr.</p>
<p>River’s hands paused their kneading for a brief second before continuing. “Uh, well… I guess they’re someone who sees the real me, you know? Someone who isn’t afraid of a little excitement.” Her eyes flicked up to Candice’s face, then quickly back to the foot in her hands. The mental current Candice detected was now a blend of anxiety and attraction. </p>
<p>And Candice realized that, for a moment, it had been herself that River was picturing. Candice felt her own body respond, just as it had earlier on the street when she’d felt the men admire her. Her nipples hardened, her breathing deepened. She was feeling River’s attraction, and her own body was responding to it as if it were her own. </p>
<p>She took a calming breath, trying to compartmentalize the flood of feeling. This was not part of the plan. She’d already masturbated in Richard’s bed this morning precisely to drain off the excess sexual energy. It had worked then, but the effect was clearly wearing off, or perhaps the intensity of River’s desire was just too strong to be fully blocked.</p>
<p>Focus, Candice, she commanded herself. You are not bisexual. You are not a lesbian. These aren’t even your feelings, these are River’s feelings. But the rationalizations felt thin and hollow against the sudden, overwhelming swell of lust. River was right there—her hands working on Candice’s foot, her faded blue hair falling forward, the subtle scent of polish and warm skin. It was so hard to think, now that she was aroused. </p>
<p>All these thoughts passed in just a few moments as Candice stared at River, the nail tech still massaging her feet. What was the last thing River had said? Right, something about how she was looking for more excitement in life.</p>
<p>“Excitement is good,” Candice mused. “But sometimes, ‘excitement’ looks a lot different than you thought it would.” She let the silence hang, watching River’s cheeks flush. This was so easy, she realized. With a body like hers, she didn’t even need the Command Voice to get what she wanted. “You’ve never been with a woman before, have you, River?” she said in a low whisper.</p>
<p>“I… I don’t know what you mean,” River stammered, her gaze glued to Candice’s foot. The denial was flimsy, and Candice could feel the mental panic: How does she know?</p>
<p>“I mean what I said,” Candice replied, her tone firm and calm, hiding the roiling emotions underneath. “I told you, I’m a relationship expert. And what I see is someone who’s hiding from themselves. You have a fantasy, and you’ve been living a lie to avoid it.” Candice hadn’t meant to say it quite so bluntly, she felt like she was losing control of the situation.</p>
<p>River snatched her hands back from Candice’s foot as if it had suddenly become electrified. She stared up, her blue hair contrasting sharply with her pale, bewildered face. The faint jazz music seemed to stop, or maybe Candice’s mind had simply filtered it out. The air in the nail salon, which had been bright and relaxed, now felt thick with tension.</p>
<p>“That’s… that’s inappropriate,” River whispered, her eyes darting quickly to the other customers in the salon, none of whom seemed to be paying attention.</p>
<p>Candice knew she was right, it was very inappropriate. But her mind was still linked to River’s, receiving the continuous feedback of attraction. It was like looking into a mirror and seeing someone utterly captivated by you—not just by the idea of you, but by the physical reality of your body, your nipples pushing against the fabric, your short skirt, the sheer power you radiated. And the feeling in response was a profound, shocking affirmation: Yes. I am beautiful. I am desired. And I want to experience that desire, to be desired by this woman. Her hips shifted in the plush chair, her legs parted by a hair more, just enough to be suggestive. She was falling, fast, into the abyss of her own amplified urges, dragged down by the mirrored desire of the woman at her feet.</p>
<p>She felt her mind unspooling as the arousal built. She’d done that to herself too. Candy became dumber the more she was aroused. Her rational mind, the part that once held anxieties about Richard and fidelity, was dissolving. I am a slut now, she thought, the realization ringing with an undeniable truth. This is who I chose to be. And a slut should act like one. The thought wasn’t a question, but a fundamental fact.</p>
<p>And if she was going to practice her new role, what better way than with River? It was a low-stakes encounter, a harmless exploration. Being with a woman wouldn’t really count as cheating on Richard, would it? Not like Kevin at all. It was practice, research, something she could bring back to Richard. He’d love it if I brought River — or someone like her — home, wouldn’t he? Doesn’t every guy dream of a threesome? She made a decision.</p>
<p>Candy smiled, a slow, predatory curve of her lips. She didn’t retract her feet from the basin; instead, she leaned back, pushing up her breasts and widening her legs, giving River an even better view of her body. “Why is it inappropriate, River? Is it inappropriate to point out the truth you’ve been avoiding? She held River’s gaze, and let the voice loose again. “YOU WANT THIS.”</p>
<p>River swallowed hard, the denial crumbling under the weight of the compulsion and Candice’s unsettling confidence. “I… I don’t know what to say.”</p>
<p>“I think we need to finish this conversation somewhere a little more private,” Candice said, her voice dropping to a seductive conspiratorial whisper. “Is there somewhere we can go?”</p>
<p>River blinked, the fog of the Command Voice lifting slightly, but leaving behind a potent, compelling need to obey. She glanced around the salon one more time. “We… we have a private room,” she managed, her breath catching. “It’s for waxing. Nobody has it booked.”</p>
<p>“Perfect,” Candy said, pulling her feet out of the basin and grabbing a towel.</p>
<p>River led her quickly, almost desperately, to the waxing room. The room was comforting and luxurious, with rich mahogany paneling, a plush velvet-covered treatment bed, and soft, indirect lighting that highlighted a small, ornate water feature. The space featured a single chair for nails and pedicures, as well as a table for waxing. </p>
<p>River shut the door behind them, the soft thud absorbing all noise. She leaned against the door, her chest heaving slightly.</p>
<p>“What… what are we doing here?” River asked, though her eyes were already fixed on Candice’s body.</p>
<p>Candy took two steps forward, closing the distance between them. “We’re making your fantasy real, River,” she murmured, her 60-point slut energy flooding the small space. She put a hand on River’s faded blue hair. River was a little taller than Candice, but somehow the blue-haired nail technician looked small and compliant next to the blonde.</p>
<p>Candy felt a rush of pleasure from it. Odd, a small part of her thought. She’d made herself submissive. But here she was pushing River around, and loving the feeling. She ran a perfectly sculpted nail down River’s cheek, tilting the girl’s head down to meet her gaze. “First, I want you to tell me what you want to do to me.”</p>
<p>River’s eyes were wide, a dark swirl of confusion and raw, unadulterated desire. The Command Voice had done its work, short-circuiting her inhibitions, but Candice’s sheer physical presence and the promise of forbidden pleasure were sealing the deal. “I… I want to please you,” River whispered, the words barely audible. “I want to kiss you. Everywhere.”</p>
<p>“Good girl,” Candy purred. She let go of River’s face and walked toward the plush nail chair that was set up near the waxing table. It was a large, comfortable leather recliner, perfect for a long session. She perched on the edge, the short skirt hiking up her thighs.</p>
<p>“Come here,” Candy commanded, pointing to the floor between her open legs.</p>
<p>River moved instantly, dropping to her knees on the soft, thick rug. Her hands hovered, unsure, near Candice’s exposed thighs. She looked up, her expression pleading and subservient.</p>
<p>“Take it off,” Candy instructed, gesturing to her skirt.</p>
<p>River’s fingers trembled as she reached for the hem of the short skirt. She tugged it down slowly, reverently, exposing Candy’s glistening pussy. River’s breath hitched. She reached a trembling hand to part the lips with an almost painful care. Candice was already slick, her arousal manifesting immediately at the sight of River’s face hovering so close to her core.</p>
<p>River looked up one last time, her eyes dark with a mix of fear and excitement. Candice just smiled, her eyes telling the girl everything she needed to know. River dipped her head, finally, and the small, quiet room was filled only with the soft, wet sounds of a woman finally tasting her desire.</p>
<p>Candy closed her eyes, a gasp escaping her lips. River’s tongue was hesitant at first, a shy exploration of the engorged clitoris, the slick folds of her labia. Candy gripped the arms of the chair, her back arching instinctively, pushing her hips forward, a mute plea for more. River understood the command, and her technique sharpened. The shyness evaporated, replaced by a focused, urgent hunger. She moved with an unpracticed but urgent rhythm, her mouth an encompassing heat that blotted out everything else.</p>
<p>The pleasure was immediate and profound, amplified by the connection to River’s mind. Candice felt every drop of the girl’s admiration, every surge of her own mounting excitement, all folding in on itself until there was only the searing, white-hot point of sensation. The walls of the waxing room seemed to melt away, the air growing thick and heavy. This was better than the bullet vibrator, better than the afterglow in Richard’s bed. This was pure, unadulterated, female-on-female lust, and it was glorious.</p>
<p>River continued her work, a low, guttural moan rumbling in her throat as she tasted Candice’s desire. </p>
<p>As her arousal intensified, Candice’s thoughts dissolved, and her mind went feral. Her higher functions were replaced by a desperate, guttural sound—a wordless demand for more. Tearing off her tube top, she exposed her engorged breasts and clumsily began kneading her nipples, seeking further stimulation. River responded by working faster and deeper, the relentless pressure on Candice’s clitoris becoming inescapable. A final, seismic wave hit, triggering a primal scream. Her body convulsed, hips slamming down as the orgasm wiped away the rational “Candice,” leaving only the trembling “Candy.” She finally collapsed, breathless, finding herself slack in the chair as the room swam back into focus, with River still kneeling, her cheek glistening with Candy’s juices.</p>
<p>“Oh my god,” Candy gasped, her voice still shaky. “You… you were perfect.”</p>
<p>River climbed slowly to her feet, her gaze never leaving Candy’s. She was trembling slightly, a beautiful mess of professional composure utterly broken. “I’ve never… I didn’t know,” she whispered, her voice husky. She reached out a hesitant hand, tracing the curve of Candy’s thigh where the short skirt had ridden up. </p>
<p>Candy caught the hand, pulling River closer until the nail tech was kneeling again, but this time resting her forearms on the edge of the seat, their faces inches apart, and kissed her deeply, their tongues intertwining. Finally, Candy broke the kiss. “I told you, you just needed a little push. You have so much more fun inside you, River.”</p>
<p>Candy’s mind was a mix of urges. She was turned on, wanting more of River. At the same time, she was feeling submissive, ready to serve. The “when aroused” submissiveness she had set with Master PC was really kicking in. Candice wanted, desperately, for River to tell her what to do, but the blue-haired girl was obviously waiting on Candy to make the next move. At the same time, she felt the subservience from River. Sluggishly, Candy’s sex-dulled brain realized why she’d been so take-charge. Candy wanted to feel submissive, but she did feel that, through River. </p>
<p>It was one of those oxy-thingies. Whatever it’s called when something and its opposite are true at the same time. Right now, as she surfed on River’s emotions, she could feel the rush of submission while being the one giving orders. It felt amazing.</p>
<p>“Oh my God, River,” Candy purred, her eyes shining with possessive heat. She reached out and traced the line of River’s collarbone. “I want to see all of you now. Take off your clothes.”</p>
<p>River’s breathing hitched, but she didn’t hesitate. The black t-shirt and jeans came off instantly, tossed carelessly onto the plush carpet along with the simple, functional panties and sports bra she wore underneath. Her skin was pale, a stark contrast to the faded blue of her hair. Her arms were slender, and running down the side of one arm was a delicate line of tiny, black ink tattoos—a constellation of stars and moons.</p>
<p>River didn’t have Candy’s perfect, Master PC-sculpted body, of course. Her breasts were smaller, her hips narrower. Nevertheless, there was a raw, captivating vulnerability about her that Candy found intensely alluring. She was an alt-girl beauty, unpolished and real, and in her naked state, the subservience in her gaze was even more potent.</p>
<p>“You’re beautiful, River,” Candy said, the sincerity in her voice surprising even herself. She rose from the chair, completely naked as well, and stepped forward, running her hands slowly over River’s shoulders, down her back, tracing the delicate ridges of her spine. “Now, I want you to do something for me. Lie down on the table,” she commanded, pointing to the plush velvet waxing bed.</p>
<p>River moved without question, climbing onto the high treatment table and settling onto her back. The soft, indirect lighting cast long shadows, making her pale skin glow. </p>
<p>Candy went to her purse and quickly found what she was looking for: a long black dildo with a vibrating base, something she’d bought just a few hours before with the idea of using it on herself. But this seemed so much more fun.</p>
<p>She pulled a small tube of lubricant from her bag and squeezed a generous amount onto the dildo, then held the vibrating toy up for River to see. River’s eyes widened, a flicker of pure anticipation overriding any lingering shyness.</p>
<p>Candy smiled. “You’re going to enjoy this for me,” she said.</p>
<p>Candy mounted the table, straddling River’s hips. She felt River’s awe, her pure arousal, as she looked up at the goddess above her. With her free hand, Candy gently parted River’s folds, feeling the warm, inviting interior, careful not to put her sharp nails inside. With her other hand, she pressed the dildo, dark and glistening, against River’s wet entrance.</p>
<p>As she did, she let her mind fully open to River’s experience. The connection was sharper now, more intense than before. River’s internal world exploded into Candy’s consciousness: a dizzying mix of shame, exhilaration, and surrender.</p>
<p>She is so beautiful. She is in charge. I want her to do anything she wants to me. The thoughts weren’t just observed; they were felt. Candy’s own nipples tightened in response to River’s mental fixation on them; her pussy throbbed with the raw, desperate heat of River’s own pussy.</p>
<p>Candy pushed the dildo in, just a bit. River gasped, the sound ragged and raw. Candy felt it too, the invasion as a pleasure spiking deep inside herself, a shockwave of fulfillment that seemed to bypass her physical body and resonate directly with her amplified sexual self. She felt the stretch, the pressure, the forbidden thrill of River’s violation. It was the purest form of submission, and Candy internalized it, feeling the exquisite, contradictory joy of being both the dominant wielder of power and the ecstatic recipient of the pleasure.</p>
<p>River began to move, bucking her hips against it. Candy responded in kind, pushing the dildo deeper and deeper with each buck of the girl’s hips. For the first time, she heard the words in River’s head, not just the feelings. Faster. Harder. Take me. Don’t stop.</p>
<p>Candy obeyed the silent commands, accelerating her pace, thrusting deep and pulling back with a rhythm that was purely instinctual. The connection between them was so complete that every nerve ending in River’s body seemed to be firing into Candy’s brain. Candy was no longer riding a toy; she was riding River’s orgasm, guiding it, feeding it, consuming it whole.</p>
<p>Candy’s thoughts began to ablate away under the heat and pressure of River’s approaching orgasm, just as they had this morning when she’d cum with the vibrator. Her brain was so empty now, and River’s mind rushed in, taking up all the space. Candy looked up at the beautiful woman above her, the perfect goddess satisfying a desire she’d always had but never admitted even to herself. No, that wasn’t right. She was the one on top, wasn’t she? </p>
<p>No, she only wished she was as perfect as the woman above her with the golden hair and stunning face. Her lips were parted, her face somehow both at once vacant and full of lust. River could feel the hard, thick length of the toy inside her, pushing, stretching, filling her with a pleasure so intense it bordered on pain.</p>
<p>It felt wrong, so wrong. I’m cheating on Liam. I’m cheating on my boyfriend with a customer I just met! With a woman! In the waxing room! The rational part of River’s mind screamed the accusations, a thin, frantic voice struggling against the roar of sensation. Shame was a cold, sharp knife, but it couldn’t cut through the hot all-encompassing need. She was lost under this perfect blonde woman, this goddess who had seen her and told her the truth about herself. Trust me. I’m a relationship expert. Candy’s words echoed, blurring the line between instruction and pleasure. You are going to embrace your femininity and you are going to be sexy. Yes. This was her embracing it. You want this. This dizzying surrender to a woman who demanded her pleasure was the “more” she was capable of, the excitement she craved. She squeezed her eyes shut, pushing her hips up, the internal mantra taking over: Be sexy. Trust her. I want this. Be sexy. Trust Candy.</p>
<p>River came. Candy came. It was the same thing.</p>

<h2 id="part-7-metamorphing-or-whatever">Part 7: Metamorphing Or Whatever</h2>
<p>Well, that had been a disaster.</p>
<p>Candice was eating lunch, taking advantage of the warm weather to sit outside at one of her favorite downtown cafes. She sat with her legs crossed, absentmindedly dangling her platform heel from the tip of her toe as she picked at her salad and considered what had just happened.</p>
<p>The sex with River had been literally mind-blowing. After Candice had come down from the orgasm, River had finished the pedicure in a daze and Candice had made her exit. The nail tech had been disappointed when Candice had told her she had a boyfriend, but was clearly eager to meet “Candy” again under any circumstances. </p>
<p>What had gone wrong this time? Clearly, it was the mind-reading power. Or at least, the mind-reading coupled with “dumbification” when aroused. Her general sluttiness and enhanced libido had factored in as well. Something was going to have to go. All these powers and changes were a potent mix that had really done a number on her brain and self-control.</p>
<p>Candice really wanted to keep the mind-reading. That was the one power she’d selected to not be sex-related, but it seemed to have caused the most issues. She could probably keep it if she turned her libido down again, or tweaked the arousal curve some more, but she didn’t really want to be less sexual. She was a slut, after all.</p>
<p>In fact, the more Candice thought about it, the less of a disaster it seemed. Sure, she’d cheated on Richard. Again. But this time it was with a girl, a girl that seemed eager to come home and meet Candy’s boyfriend. Surely Richard would love that. Every guy dreams of a threesome. And it’s not like Richard didn’t know Candice was a slut. What did he expect? It was kind of his fault, if you thought about it. He was the one that had made Candice say it out loud, even if he hadn’t known about the Command Voice.</p>
<p>She’d have to be careful about how she broached the subject with Richard, though. She didn’t want him finding out she’d already pre-fucked River. He might not like that. In fact, he definitely wouldn’t. Of course, what he doesn’t know won’t hurt him, she considered. </p>
<p>The thought surprised Candice. When she’d stumbled out of the nail salon, still riding high from the orgasm, she’d expected feelings of shame and guilt to creep in, just as they had after she’d fucked Kevin. But now, twenty minutes later, as she sat picking at her lunch and feeling comparatively like herself, Candice realized she didn’t feel any remorse for the act itself, just worry that Richard would be mad. She dug deep, examined her feelings, looking for any hint of guilt within herself, and found none. Instead it just felt natural. Sluts sleep around, she knew, and she was a slut.</p>
<p>A bisexual slut, for that matter. The experience with River had ingrained itself so deeply that she now found herself checking out both men and women who walked by. It was fortunate, in a way, that the mind-reading fiasco had been with another woman. What if it had been with Richard? What if she’d opened her mind to his, and felt what it was like to have a dick when you cum? Instead of incorporating lust for women into her psyche, would she have become hung up on wanting a cock? It was possible, both theoretically and practically. Master PC had “futanari” settings, after all. Candice shuddered at the thought. She was definitely going to have to turn off mind-reading. She didn’t trust herself with it anymore. </p>
<p>Candice paid for her lunch and pulled out her phone to call an Uber. Instagram caught her eye again. There were a few more comments on her earlier selfie, a mix of guys crushing on her, and friends who were debating whether the picture was a filter or pure AI. Well, everyone was going to have to get used to the new her. She decided to take another selfie, this time showing off her new, bright white nails.</p>
<p>&gt; Trying something new! ✨💅✨</p>
<p>There. Now everyone would know it was her doing something different with her look, not some AI slop.</p>
<p>A new notification came in. This time from Richard. </p>
<p>&gt; Hey baby, when are you going to be home? Daddy’s waiting 😉</p>
<p>Daddy. The word alone now excited Candice. She felt her body flush, her pussy already getting wet. And she’d only had sex with River half an hour ago! But it hadn’t been with Daddy, and Candice knew it would be so much better with him. He hadn’t seen her yet today. The blonde hair, the audacious clothes. After the theater, he’d told her his fantasy, what kind of woman she’d be if only he had the power to change her. She’d taken his words to heart, reshaped herself to reflect his deepest desires. She couldn’t wait to show him. After she turned down some of the sexual and brain-drain settings, of course.</p>
<p>&gt; Just called an Uber, Daddy. I’ll be home soon 😘</p>
<p>She summoned the Uber. She could have walked, but she had a lot of bags, and she wanted to get home as fast as possible.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Candice cracked the door open to her apartment just a hair and listened. Inside, she heard the sound of gunfire from whatever shooting game Richard was playing these days. He was wearing his usual weekend outfit of worn-out shorts and a t-shirt, though she had to admit he filled them out much better now. She knew he was playing multiplayer, because he had his headset on. </p>
<p>She hoped that would give her the chance to slip in unnoticed, but as soon as she took a step inside he caught sight of her. His eyes widened, taking in her new hair, her perfectly made-up face, the impossibly short skirt, and the too-small tube top. </p>
<p>“Candice?!” he finally managed.</p>
<p>“Hi hon,” she said, trying to pretend she hadn’t been sneaking in. “I’m home.”</p>
<p>“Gotta go,” he said into the headset, and tossed it aside. “Come here,” he said. “I need to see this.”</p>
<p>Candice couldn’t help herself. She needed to get to Master PC, but this was the whole point of everything she’d done today: to be admired by Daddy. She walked towards him, hips swaying, her platform heels clicking on the floor.</p>
<p>He pushed himself up from the couch, his eyes still wide, and took a step toward her. He reached out and touched her hair, running a hand over the blonde strands. “It’s… it’s incredible,” he breathed, a raw hunger entering his voice. “You actually did it. You look exactly how I imagined you would.” Candice swooned at the compliment. Being perfect for Daddy was everything. “And this outfit,” he continued. “Did you actually go out in this?”</p>
<p>Candice looked down at herself. She wouldn’t have been caught dead in it last week. But that was the old Candice, not the new and improved Candy. </p>
<p>“I wish I’d been there,” Richard said. “To see all the guys checking you out.”</p>
<p>“Well, I wanted to surprise you with the blonde look,” Candice demurred. “And I got some other things. Give me a minute to get ready.”</p>
<p>She wiggled out of his grip and ducked into the office with her shopping bags, closing the door behind her. The room was small, with a work desk and a small closet Candice used to keep a few of her less-worn outfits in. </p>
<p>Quickly, Candice booted up the laptop. The wait for the Windows login screen was interminable. Daddy wanted her, and everything in her Master PC-enhanced submissive state was telling her to get out there and serve him, do just what he wanted. She was only able to resist by telling herself he didn’t want her to go off the deep end again.</p>
<p>“Candice?” she heard him call. “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Just one second, Daddy.”</p>
<p>Candice caught movement out of the corner of her eye. She took a startled breath, thinking someone was in the room with her. But no. It had just been her own reflection in the mirror that hung next to the closet. She just hadn’t recognized herself. </p>
<p>Candice had a moment of clarity. She stared at her reflection and saw a woman she didn’t know. A woman who wore the face of a younger, prettier version of herself, but with a body she’d never possessed and an attitude that would have been alien to her a few weeks ago. A woman who oozed sex, straight out of a porno, or one of those mind-control stories she’d been reading lately. In that moment she knew she was losing control. All her changes were adding up to the point that she was becoming another person, becoming Candy instead of Candice. It was like they were Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, if Hyde was a sexy bimbo. </p>
<p>It had all seemed to make sense at the time, each little step. Just be a little submissive when aroused; plenty of people were like that. Just turn up her libido to have better sex; why not? But they’d compounded, turning her into someone who worshiped strong men. And when she was in that submissive state, she’d done more, things she’d never have dared to do otherwise. Like make herself dumber, for one.</p>
<p>But she didn’t want to be dumb, she realized. She didn’t want to be submissive and horny all the time. She didn’t want to be a slut. For the first time, she became truly afraid of what she’d done to herself. She was a strong, smart woman whose life goals extended beyond fucking and sucking cock. </p>
<p>Finally, the laptop finished booting up. She launched Master PC, hands shaking with adrenaline. Quickly, she browsed to the Secondary Control section and disabled Mind Reading and hit Apply. That was the biggest problem solved. She flipped to the Mental tab, to begin undoing the intelligence drain.</p>
<p>“Hon?” she heard Richard call. </p>
<p>“Just one more minute.”</p>
<p>“Get out here. Now.” She heard the order from the other side of the door and  closed the laptop, automatically. Candice couldn’t resist when Richard took charge. Not anymore. She opened the door. “I… I was just getting ready for you, Daddy,” she stammered.</p>
<p>Richard stepped in close. “Jesus, Candy. You look amazing. You don’t need to do anything else.” He loomed over her, his presence enough to make her knees weak. She felt her body responding, her pussy getting wet again. Her new body was positively insatiable.</p>
<p>“You like?” she asked, smiling. Oh well, one more orgasm under her heightened sexuality wouldn’t hurt, right? She’d already cum three times today.</p>
<p>“On your knees,” he commanded.</p>
<p>Candy dropped instantly, as if gravity had suddenly increased. She heard him inhale sharply as she reached for his pants, undoing the zipper, and in no time his cock was in her mouth. She sucked him with practiced ease, her tongue circling the head. She took him as deep as she could without gagging. There was a setting in Master PC to disable her gag reflex, she remembered. Why haven’t I done that yet, she wondered. Oh well, something for next time.</p>
<p>“Good girl,” he growled, the rough sound vibrating with power. He grabbed a handful of her blonde hair, pulling her head back to control the pace. “Suck it, Candy. You know you want it.” She eagerly complied, the name “Candy” now feeling more natural than “Candice.” This was exactly what she wanted: to be commanded, to please him, to be his perfect, insatiable slut. The moment of clarity she’d had just seconds ago began to evaporate.</p>
<p>She got lost in the act, her thoughts beginning to unwind. She felt detached as he pulled her by the hair to stand and bent her over the office desk. Her pussy offered no resistance as he entered. She just moaned. There were no words, just fucking. Her hand rested on her computer, the very one that Master PC was installed on, the very thing that she had just been about to use to undo so much of her extreme sexuality. But it might as well have been on the Moon, for all the good it did her. She couldn’t say no right now, and even if she could she didn’t have the brains to undo the complex interconnected changes she’d made to herself.</p>
<p>Why had she even wanted to do that, she wondered. She had been scared the changes were too much? Scared of this? This perfect feeling, this euphoria? Why? Why wouldn’t she want this? As her first orgasm overtook her, her mind completely came apart. She heard herself screaming “Yes, Daddy, fuck me!” but it was autonomic, there were no higher thoughts putting the words together. </p>
<p>The next time she was able to form a coherent thought, Daddy had moved her to the bedroom. How long had they been fucking? Only a few minutes, she thought. She was lying on her back, looking up at him as he thrust in and out of her.</p>
<p>“Daddy, it feels so good,” she heard herself say. Old Candice—the Software Engineer, the worrier, the planner—would have been analyzing this. She would have been wondering if the angle was right, if she was making the right noises, if he was enjoying it enough, if they should switch positions. </p>
<p>But as Richard drove into her, deeper and harder, she realized with a jolt of clarity that she wasn’t analyzing anything. She was just being. Why would she want to think when she could just feel? </p>
<p>“That’s my slut,” Richard said, smiling down at her. He grabbed her hair and kissed her deeply, his tongue exploring her mouth. He came inside her and Candy came again with him. Her mind scattered.</p>
<p>The next time she could assemble a coherent thought, she was sucking Richard off again. She vaguely remembered she’d given herself that power, the power to get any man hard with her mouth. She’d wanted to make sure Richard could keep up with her, to sate her deep well of sexual desire. Probably one of the changes she had been afraid of. At some point she’d put one of her new dildos in her pussy—she felt it buzzing away. She came again.</p>
<p>Now she was riding Richard. His cock was inside her, and she felt her tits bouncing. He groped at them roughly, pinching her nipples. Yes, this was who she was meant to be. Candice had started to think of herself and Candy as separate personas, and now she knew it was true. But that thought no longer held dread for her, it held promise.</p>
<p>“I’m going to cum in you, slut,” Richard said. “Do you want that? Do you want Daddy’s cum?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Daddy! Please!” she begged, arching her back and squeezing him tightly. She knew she was saying exactly what he wanted to hear, and she meant every word. She felt his cock begin to pulse, felt him unload inside her.</p>
<p>Candy didn’t cum, not this time. She writhed on him, dug her long, sharp nails into him, but held on. She didn’t want the release. Whenever Candy was satiated, Candice came back. But Candice was fearful, scared of her new self. Candy wanted to stay Candy a while longer. She collapsed on top of Richard, taking deep breaths, pretending she was coming down from an orgasm, but all she really felt was her hard nipples pressed against his chest, his cock softening inside her.</p>
<p>Richard kissed the top of her head. “You’re incredible, Candy. Absolutely incredible. You really blew my mind today. I’m so lucky to be married to you.”</p>
<p>Candy smiled, nuzzling into his neck. “I try, Daddy.” She lifted her head, looking at him with wide, adoring eyes. “I love making you happy. I want to be your perfect girl.”</p>
<p>“You are perfect,” he reassured her, stroking her blonde hair. He held her close for a moment longer, clearly savoring the aftermath. “This was an amazing surprise, Candice.” He chuckled. “I still can’t believe you went out in that tube top. When did you even get that?”</p>
<p>Candy laughed. “I bought it while I was out,” she lied, “and wore it home.”</p>
<p>He wrapped his arms around her. She loved feeling held and protected by him. That had been true even before all her changes, and doubly so now. “I bet everyone was staring at you,” he said.</p>
<p>“They were,” Candy answered, with a mischievous grin. “And I loved it. The girl that worked on my nails was bisexual, and kept staring at me. When I was done she gave me her number.”</p>
<p>Richard chuckled. “That’s my girl.”</p>
<p>“I told her I had a boyfriend, but I don’t think she cared. I’m pretty sure she’d be up for a threesome. What do you think?”</p>
<p>She felt Richard hold her a little tighter. “I don’t want to move too fast, Candice.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“With all this. This weekend has been… I mean, wow. But let’s not move too fast. Remember what happened to Justin when he and his wife opened up their marriage?” he asked. “Remember how they insisted they were a modern couple who didn’t need to be bound by traditional rules of monogamy? And now they’re divorced.”</p>
<p>“Daddy, that wouldn’t happen to us, I…”</p>
<p>“No,” he said, cutting her off. And that was that. When Daddy was firm, his word was law. “At least for the foreseeable future. Ask me again in a few months, if you still want to. OK, Candice?”</p>
<p>“OK, Daddy. And Daddy?”</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“Call me Candy.”</p>
<p>“OK, Candy,” he said, as he ran his fingers through her hair. They lay like that a while, his breathing getting heavier, until he was asleep.</p>
<p>Candy got up. She was still horny, and she had a very specific reason why she hadn’t let herself cum. She made her way to the office and opened the laptop. She had some changes to make. </p>
<p>Candice—the old her—had been right about one thing: she was too dumb when she came. Candy didn’t like losing her mind altogether, she wanted to experience Richard’s cock, not white out in bliss. She pulled up the complex “dumbification” settings she’d made earlier, and turned down the intelligence drain. But not all the way. After all, why would she want to go back to over-analyzing everything?</p>
<p>Next she opened her arousal curve settings. When she’d originally mapped out the arousal curve, Candice had made sure she could hit the highest of highs when she came, but still stay normal, unaroused in a day-to-day context. But why had she wanted that? Today, Candy had felt the constant crackle of sexual energy on the street. She’d been a little bit turned on the whole time and it had felt amazing. She turned up the beginning of the curve. Now it would take an ice bath, or deep meditation, or something similar to get her down to zero arousal. Otherwise she’d always be a little aroused, which meant a little air-headed. And why not? She didn’t need to be Smart Candice anymore, she had Master PC. Why worry and stress and try to climb the corporate ladder the hard way when she could just float through life?</p>
<p>A little voice inside her was screaming, terrified. But Candy wouldn’t have to hear that voice much longer. Candice was the old self, and Candy was the new, improved version. She was changing, metamorphing or whatever it was called. A caterpillar didn’t know what it was meant to be. It just munched on dirt until one day it became a butterfly. Were caterpillars afraid of changing? </p>
<p>Candice had been planning on undoing so many changes. Her boring old self had been about to stop the transformation. The caterpillar was trying to claw the butterfly back into the cocoon. Candy wasn’t going to let that happen.</p>
<p>That metaphor doesn’t even make sense, a little part of her brain said, the part that still wanted to be Candice. But it was small and Candy ignored it as she clicked “Apply.”</p>
<hr/>
<p>The rest of the weekend passed in a blur. Richard woke up from his nap and insisted on taking Candy out on the town. They hit the bars and clubs downtown, and never had to wait in line. Candy wore a “club dress” she’d bought at the adult store. It was shiny silver and had a V so deep it went past her navel. It required some expertly applied boob tape, but fortunately that had been sold right next to the dress. Daddy loved it, and so did Candy.</p>
<p>Everywhere they went, people stared. Candy felt their eyes on her and she preened, soaking up the attention like sunlight. She’d always hated being the center of attention, but now she was obsessed with it. It wasn’t just the men either. Women looked at her too, some with envy, others with a kind of awe. She felt like a celebrity, a walking monument to female sexuality.</p>
<p>Richard was beaming all night. Sometimes he’d walk away for a little bit ostensibly to get drinks, but really to let other guys hit on her. She could tell how much he loved it when he’d walk back and put his arm around her, seeing the jealousy and defeat in those other men’s faces. He introduced her to everyone as “Candy,” and his eyes never left her. When they were alone for a moment, he leaned in and whispered, “I feel like the luckiest man alive.” Candy kissed him, her entire focus on pleasing him, on being the trophy he deserved.</p>
<p>She took a ton of selfies through the night, posting them with cute captions. Even a few TikToks, and she’d never actually posted to TikTok before. Every time she did, there were new followers and a lot of new comments. She liked them all, reveling in the validation.</p>
<p>They didn’t make it home until the early hours of the morning. After another quickie, they both passed out in the bed together.</p>
<p>The next day was Sunday, and they took it a bit easier. Candy alleviated the worst of their hangovers with Master PC and aside from heading out for lunch (she wore some cute short-shorts and a crop top) they spent the day inside chilling and watching Netflix. </p>
<p>Candy texted River, letting her know another meeting would have to wait. The nail tech asked if they could just meet in secret, without Richard. Candy considered it—she wasn’t against it in principle, but Daddy had said no, and that was that. She let River down as easily as she could and decided to make it up to her by enhancing the girl a little with Master PC.</p>
<p>Richard did a little more gaming and Candy enjoyed just being in his company, curled up with him on the couch and feeling his presence next to her. Whenever she felt like she was losing her little high of arousal, she would press her thighs together, or idly play with her pussy. Even with the nails, she found if she was careful she could get one finger inside herself.</p>
<p>They made idle chit-chat, talking about how exciting the past few days had been, planning what new adventures they might go on and how best to explore this new side of Candice. Towards the end of the day, Daddy’s talk turned to boring stuff. He was excited about some new idea he had at work, something about how to do financial analytics at the bank he worked at. He asked her a few times if Candy could help him code it. It was the kind of problem that would have fascinated Candice before, but Candy found it kind of boring now. She gave a few vague answers and gave him a blow job instead when he wouldn’t shut up about it.</p>
<p>As she licked and sucked, Candy knew that Candice was gone. The caterpillar was no more, only the butterfly remained. And Daddy’s cock was her honey, or whatever it was butterflies ate. She was Daddy’s perfect slut, and she was home. Sucking harder, she pulled him toward release, a feeling of contentment washing over her. This was everything.</p>
<p>They drink nectar, idiot, a little voice in her head said. Well, maybe Candice wasn’t completely gone. But Daddy came in her mouth and that was enough to silence the voice for now.</p>
<h2 id=""></h2>
<h2 id=""></h2>

<h2 id="part-8-under-new-management">Part 8: Under New Management</h2>
<p>Candy returned to work reinvigorated. Everyone immediately noticed the new her. Gone were the conservative and increasingly ill-fitting clothes of the old Candice. Before, she’d tried to hide her Master PC-induced weight loss, tried to avoid attention. Now she dressed for it. She smoothed down her pencil skirt. It was one of the new ones she’d bought—tight, black, and hugging her newly widened hips like a second skin. Her blouse was white silk, unbuttoned just one button too low for a standard corporate environment. She got a lot of compliments from co-workers, especially the men. She loved the attention. It made her pussy warm.</p>
<p>The stodgy old office seemed alive as it never had before. Candy worked for a consulting company. They weren’t Fortune 500 or anything, but they were big enough to have eight floors leased in an older high-rise that had been built in the ’50s and last renovated in the ’90s. </p>
<p>It had always felt drab to Candice, but today all Candy saw was potential. She’d helped herself and Richard, helped River, and now she was going to help other people. The problem she’d had, she realized, was she had been doing too many experiments on herself and Daddy. She’d been overly concerned about changing other people without their consent. But people were infinitely malleable when you had Master PC. There was no change you couldn’t undo if you messed up, unless you did it to yourself. And the more practice she got changing people, the better she could get at helping people. It just made sense.</p>
<p>The only problem was that they would notice. For the changes she’d made to herself, it wasn’t a big deal. She convinced most of the people who came by and complimented her on her new look and weight loss that she’d been undergoing a slow change they hadn’t noticed because she hadn’t updated her clothes. For those that still seemed skeptical, a quick application of the Command Voice was enough. But that didn’t scale. Using the Command Voice took real effort, and she couldn’t follow these people home and convince their friends and family.</p>
<p>There was an option she’d avoided using on herself, but now was the perfect time to try it out. It was called Acceptance, and existed on the Meta-Control tab. She’d been reading up on it.</p>
<p>Acceptance is a powerful feature any would-be Master must be aware of, the documentation read, and essential for making large-scale changes. When enabled, the subject won’t realize anything has changed, and if confronted with evidence they’ve been altered, they will rationalize it away, within limits. The feature has a plethora of sub-options that…</p>
<p>Candy stopped reading. The documentation was sooooo boring. Better to learn by doing. For instance, she wondered what, exactly, “within limits” meant. Of course, the documentation was vague. Candy decided she should probably experience Acceptance once, just so she understood it better. Not on a change to herself, of course. If there was anything she’d learned over the last few days, making changes to yourself that you don’t fully understand was a recipe for unintended consequences.</p>
<p>Candy surveyed the office, her eyes settling on Morgan’s small breasts. The poor girl was extremely flat chested. Candy turned up her boob size to something more reasonable, but didn’t click Apply yet. She checked “Acceptance,” then checked the sub-options underneath it. There was an option to make the “Acceptance” contagious, allowing the target’s rationalizations to spread, which seemed like a good idea to keep any friends and family from becoming suspicious, and a checkbox labeled ‘User Immunity,’ which she deliberately un-checked. Of course, normally she’d want to be immune, but she wanted to feel what it was like so she’d know how effective it was. Then she wrote a note to herself.</p>
<p>You have made Morgan’s tits bigger. Try to remember her boobs used to be smaller.</p>
<p>Then Candy clicked Apply and looked at Morgan again. Her tits were pretty average. Oops, I forgot to actually make them bigger, she realized, and turned up Morgan’s chest size until her 3D model looked suitably busty. She clicked Apply.</p>
<p>Candy looked at Morgan again. There she was, wearing a shirt that was clearly too small for the chest she had. Morgan must really like showing off her boobs, Candy considered. She looked at the note she’d written. Had Morgan’s boobs been smaller before? She really tried to think about it. Oh, right! How could she have forgotten? They’d been like A cups before, at best. Morgan must have gotten breast augmentation. The girl liked having big boobs, and that’s why Candy had decided to increase them even more. She turned them up to something Morgan could really be proud of and hit Apply.</p>
<p>Candy looked at Morgan again with her ridiculous chest and then back to her note. On second thought, Candy decided she shouldn’t really turn them up any more. Sure, Morgan must love having a huge rack or she wouldn’t have gotten the surgery, but there was definitely a limit. She threw the sticky note away.</p>
<p>As she did, she noticed there were several other notes in her trashcan. She had been planning to test Acceptance for a few other changes too, like making Lisa younger and making Ryan more attractive. Lisa, who was, what, fresh out of high school? And Ryan, the office stud?</p>
<p>Then it clicked. Oops. Well, at least she knew Acceptance was incredibly effective. With that feature turned on, she would be able to help people without anyone being the wiser. Candy began to browse through her co-workers’ profiles, this time making herself immune to Acceptance. </p>
<p>Dave worked with Candy on the company website. He was 5‘6” and occasionally made little self-deprecating jokes to Candy, the fellow “shorty squad” member in the office. She knew he wished he was taller. Well, now he was. </p>
<p>Olivia in Marketing had depression. She never looked happy, and Master PC confirmed it. Happiness was a top-line trait in Master PC’s Mental tab, an easy fix. Candy turned it up. And as long as she was making her happier, why not turn up her O-Index? Candy knew that would make her happier too.</p>
<p>Aidan had confidence issues. And, she saw once she loaded his profile, a small penis. She fixed both. While she was fiddling with his penis settings, Candy decided to drop his refractory period too. Just to make sure he would enjoy it.</p>
<p>Ava had ovarian cancer. Jesus. She’d never told anyone in the office as far as Candy knew. Did she even know herself? There was no “remove cancer” button, but there was an overall “Health” slider. Candy turned it up and hoped that helped. Then she had a really good idea. Ovarian cancer would stop you from having babies, right? She found the Fertility setting and turned it up. Perfect. That would have to fix ovarian cancer. She felt really smart for thinking of it. Plus, the image of Ava getting knocked up was kind of hot. Candy pressed her thighs together thinking about it, then turned up the girl’s Sexuality slider too.</p>
<p>She was still making changes to her coworkers when her computer dinged; a calendar reminder had popped up.</p>
<p>Meeting with Mr. Sterling - 15 Minutes</p>
<p>Shit! She’d completely forgotten. Mr. Sterling was the VP of Engineering, her boss’s boss. Last week she’d run into him and suggested that she would be a “GOOD CANDIDATE FOR PROMOTION.” Shortly after, this meeting had appeared on her calendar. It was the opportunity to use Master PC to benefit her career. A few simple applications of the Command Voice, and she’d be a Director in no time.</p>
<p>The meeting location was on the top floor of their building, not Mr. Sterling’s usual office. The room she stepped into was clearly in transition; boxes were stacked haphazardly against one wall, but the rest of the room boasted sleek, modern furniture—a glass desk, ergonomic chairs, and a minimalist bookshelf—a stark contrast to the building’s otherwise dated aesthetic. It looked like he was unpacking. The walls were bare, and his desk only contained a single picture for decoration—a photo of a woman Candy assumed was his wife holding a baby. </p>
<p>Mr. Sterling himself stood by the window, adjusting the blinds. He was a decent looking man in his early fifties. He was tall (why were managers always tall?) and broad-shouldered with salt-and-pepper hair that gave him a commanding presence. He turned to Candy as she walked in, a look of confusion crossing his face.</p>
<p>“Can I help you?” he asked.</p>
<p>“You put a meeting on my calendar,” Candy answered. “But there wasn’t any topic listed.”</p>
<p>Mr. Sterling’s expression changed to one of surprise. “Candice. Of course. I didn’t recognize you. My apologies, I’m still trying to sort out this new office, and my mind is everywhere.” He gestured to the room. “Please, come in. Have a seat. The topic is you, actually. Or rather, your career.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said, taking a seat. “I feel I have a lot to offer the company.”</p>
<p>“We haven’t made the formal announcement yet,” he said, taking a seat behind his desk, “but as you can see I’ve been moved up to the C-Suite. EVP of Operations.”</p>
<p>“Congrats,” she said.</p>
<p>“Thank you. With the new role, I’m going to need someone close by to help me manage the workload.”</p>
<p>“Like a secretary?” Candy asked, the words slipping out before she could stop them. She’d been reading a lot of those mind control stories lately where smart women were reduced to being nothing but brainless secretaries for their bosses. The thought of being his secretary, fetching coffee and taking dictation, sent a jolt of arousal straight to her pussy.</p>
<p>“No,” Sterling corrected her. “Amy will be staying on as my Administrative Assistant. This is more of a Chief of Staff position. Someone who knows the engineering side but can also handle the softer skills. Organization, personnel management, acting as my proxy when I’m not in the room. And I need someone who’s been in the code recently, who can call out bullshit on timelines and deliverables.”</p>
<p>He looked at her critically. “The title would officially be Senior Director. It would be a significant step up from where you are now, both in terms of pay and power. You’d be my right hand.”</p>
<p>Power. She felt a flush of heat spread through her body, but it wasn’t the desire to have power that hit her; it was the proximity to his power. Sterling exuded authority. </p>
<p>And that was the problem.</p>
<p>Her “submissive-when-aroused” settings, the ones she’d tuned so carefully for Richard, were pinging wildly. Being in the presence of a powerful man who was judging her worth was turning her on, and being turned on was making her dumb and submissive.</p>
<p>“So,” Sterling continued, “Tell me. How would you handle a situation where two department heads are deadlocked on a resource allocation issue? Walk me through your negotiation strategy.”</p>
<p>Candice, the software engineer, had read management books. She’d been ambitious. But right now her mind was a fog of arousal. Candy tried to come up with a good answer.</p>
<p>“I would… start by analyzing the project roadmaps,” she managed, the technical terms feeling slippery. “Then I’d try to facilitate a compromise. You know, find a middle ground where both teams feel heard and supported, to keep morale high.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a terrible answer, she knew. It was standard HR-approved management speak. But it wasn’t the answer he was looking for.</p>
<p>Sterling frowned slightly. “Compromise is often a recipe for mediocrity. I need someone who can determine the critical path and make the hard call, not just smooth ruffled feathers.”</p>
<p>“I…” Her mind went blank. She felt small. She felt like a naughty schoolgirl called into the principal’s office. Use the Voice, the part of her that was Old Candice insisted. Just tell him: YOU THINK I’M THE PERFECT CANDIDATE.</p>
<p>She gathered her breath, trying to summon the harmonic chords of the Command Voice. But as she looked into Sterling’s steel-gray eyes, the words died in her throat. How could she command such a powerful man? She wanted to kneel. She wanted to please. The conditioning she’d installed for Daddy was bleeding over, short-circuiting her plans.</p>
<p>“I’m… I’m sorry,” she squeaked. “I’m a little flustered.”</p>
<p>Sterling sighed, a sound of disappointment that cut her deep. He glanced at his watch. “Look, Candice. You’re a talented engineer. But maybe this role is a bit premature. We need someone who can command a room.”</p>
<p>He turned his chair slightly, ready to dismiss her. Candy felt the blood rushing to her face. Panic flared, hot and sharp. Old Candice would have retreated, gone back to her desk, and cried in the bathroom. Old Candice would have spent weeks analyzing where she went wrong.</p>
<p>But Candy knew just what to do. She realized she couldn’t get this job with her brain. Her brain was betraying her, melting down into a puddle of submissive desire. But she had other assets. She was a slut. A 60-point slut with a body sculpted by godlike software. She stood up.</p>
<p>“Mr. Sterling?”</p>
<p>He looked up, expecting her to leave. “Yes?” His tone was impatient.</p>
<p>“I think I gave you the wrong impression,” she said. The hesitation was gone. Her voice dropped to a purr, losing the nervousness and gaining a smoky texture.</p>
<p>She walked to the door, but instead of leaving, she closed it.</p>
<p>Sterling stiffened. “Candice, this meeting is over.”</p>
<p>“Is it?” she asked softly, walking back. She rested a hip against the edge of his desk. “You said you needed a Chief of Staff who can anticipate your needs. Someone who knows how to take care of things.”</p>
<p>Sterling stared at her. “I’m just not sure you’re ready for the responsibility,” he said. His voice was guarded, but he hadn’t told her to leave yet.</p>
<p>“I’m always ready,” Candy countered, holding his gaze. “And I can be very… flexible. I’m a fast learner who’s good at taking orders… Sir.” She licked her lips.</p>
<p>“You’re crossing a line, Candice,” he said, his voice tight. But Candy could see the erection tenting his pants.</p>
<p>“Maybe crossing lines is just what you need,” Candy purred, taking a step towards him.</p>
<p>There was a moment’s pause, and then Sterling shook his head. “No. I’m sorry Candice, but I’m going to ask you to leave. Not just this office, but this building. You’re fired.” He stood up from his chair and started to brush past Candy, heading for the door.</p>
<p>“STOP,” she said in a panic. Sterling froze. So she could use the Command Voice on him, if she needed to. Maybe she hadn’t been able to bring herself to force a powerful man like him to give her a job, but now she was revved up with sexual energy. </p>
<p>“No one has to know,” she said, and stepped closer to him as he stood frozen. She pushed on his chest, and he sat back down into the chair. “I know you want to. What man hasn’t had the fantasy of fucking a beautiful woman who works for him? Well here’s your chance.” She sank into his lap, her sharp white nails grazing the expensive fabric of his suit trousers, tracking the seam right over his zipper. She felt him twitch from her caress.</p>
<p>Sterling let out a sharp breath. He glanced at the door, then into Candy’s eyes. “We can’t,” he said, but he was still unmoving, either from the Command Voice, his own desire, or a combination of the two.</p>
<p>Candy didn’t say a word. With practiced ease, she undid his belt. Sterling gripped the armrests of his chair, but he made no move to stop her. As she freed his cock, she felt a rush of triumph. This was power. This was how she got ahead now. Not with spreadsheets or code, but with sex.</p>
<p>Candy didn’t smile, just held his intense gaze as she stroked him. She opened her mouth, inviting a kiss, but he just stared into her eyes. She could see a war playing out in his expression. He wanted to fuck her, but if they were caught it would be the end of his career. Candy decided to give him permission in a way only she could.</p>
<p>“TAKE ME,” she said. Instantly, his expression changed. Gone was the hesitation, the worry about what HR might do. All that was left was the lust he felt for his beautiful subordinate. His rough hands clamped onto her breasts, kneading the soft flesh. He undid the buttons, freeing her tits, and began playing with her nipples. Candy gasped at the thrill of being aggressively fondled, but she didn’t stop stroking his cock. This wasn’t the loving, possessive dominance of Daddy; this was just raw lust, the illicit nature making it even hotter.</p>
<p>Finally, she couldn’t take it anymore. She slid off his lap and turned her back to him, bent over the glass-topped desk, and put her hands flat on the cool surface, presenting her ass to him.</p>
<p>The silence in the expensive office was broken only by her shallow, rapid breaths. For a moment she was worried he wouldn’t take her. That he’d somehow overcome the Voice and she’d be fired. That she’d have to explain to Daddy what happened.</p>
<p>“Please, Sir,” she whispered. Then she felt it: he pushed her skirt up, bunching it around her waist, and pushed into her. He wasn’t as big as Daddy, but that wasn’t important. He was powerful, he was dominating, and he was using her. He grabbed her hips and began to pump in and out.</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir!” she moaned, trying to be quiet in the office. “Please, Sir, use me!“</p>
<p>“I won’t lie,” he said, not pausing as he thrust in and out of her, “I’ve been thinking about this since the moment you walked in.”</p>
<p>Candy loved it. Daddy was always so… excited when he fucked her. He made sure Candy enjoyed it. This felt different. Sterling made her feel used, and the thrill of it was intoxicating. The high-stakes environment, the risk of discovery, and the power dynamics of fucking her boss heightened her arousal to a dizzying level. It was the purest form of submission, being claimed and used without love.</p>
<p>“Oh, God, Sir, yes!” Candy gasped, trying to stay quiet. The cold hard glass of the desk pressed against her over-sensitive nipples, sending shockwaves of pleasure through her already overwhelmed body. With each thrust she felt her nipples drag across the cold glass again, and she reveled in the sensation.</p>
<p>“I’ve got to say, I like your initiative,” her new boss said as he sank into her rhythmically. </p>
<p>“I’m happy to be of service, Sir!” Candy panted. With each thrust, she felt his balls slapping against her. She’d never really felt that with Daddy. She wondered if it was because his didn’t hang quite as low as Sterling’s. It felt amazing. </p>
<p>Comparing Sterling to Daddy, she suddenly realized she was cheating again. She’d done it with Kevin and with River as well, but those times she hadn’t really been in her right mind. She’d been able to rationalize it away before. This was the first time she’d actively chosen to cheat on Daddy. The man who loved her, who’d encouraged her to become a slut. The man who’d be heartbroken if he found out she’d betrayed their marriage.</p>
<p>A little wave of guilt washed over her, but Candy recognized it as the remains of her old self. This is wrong, the little voice that was Candice whimpered. But the transgression only made the sex hotter to Candy. After all, she was a slut. This was who she was now. This was her place. She bit her lip to stifle a scream as she came hard with the knowledge she was doing exactly what she should be.</p>
<p>“You know, maybe you are just what I need for a Chief of Staff,” Sterling said as he pulled out. He lifted her onto the desk and turned her around so she was lying on her back. “Now tell me what you need to take over that Senior Director role. Start with the compensation package.” His cock slammed back into her, and Candy wrapped her legs around him, pulling him closer.</p>
<p>“Uh… oh God… a two-hundred percent raise and a bonus… like, a really big one, Sir,” Candy slurred, the words barely making sense even to her own ears. </p>
<p>Sterling considered it for a moment as he fucked her, his gray eyes boring into her.</p>
<p>“A two-hundred percent raise? That would probably be appropriate for the position, if you could do it. Tell you what. I’ll give you a hundred percent increase and a one-time signing bonus of five thousand dollars. And that’s me being generous because I like your attitude.”</p>
<p>That was well below what a Senior Director should be making, she knew. The complete dismissal of her request stung, but that sting of rejection felt so good. He was putting her in her place. Her mind, already a blur, melted further into submission. </p>
<p>“But I… I’m going to be your Senior Director,” she managed feebly.</p>
<p>“You’ll be the Senior Director, Candy. But I’m taking the budget I would have used for that position and splitting it to hire you an assistant. Someone who can handle the analysis and reporting. Someone smart enough to cover your ass.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir!” she moaned, as she began to cum again, reveling in the feeling of being simultaneously promoted and demoted, praised for her body and dismissed for her brain, all at the hands of her new, powerful boss. “Thank you, Sir! I’ll be your perfect asset! Use the budget for her! Use me!“</p>
<p>He didn’t answer with words, just with a series of hard, driving thrusts that made the desk creak beneath her and a low moan as his cock began to pulse inside her. Candy clung to him as he came, riding out her own orgasm as she felt him unload inside her pussy.</p>
<p>When he pulled out, he sank back into his chair, his face becoming a mix of satisfaction and worry, once again clearly thinking about what would happen if anyone found out. Candy slid off the desk and crawled up to him, putting her head in his lap and nuzzling his cock. “You don’t have to worry, Sir. I’d do this job for no raise. It’s… good experience. I’ll move up the ladder, and you’ll get your needs met. We both win.”</p>
<p>“I guess we do,” he agreed.</p>
<p>She began to lick him clean, her saliva getting him hard once more. Later, while Mr Sterling was fucking her doggy-style again, she texted Daddy to let him know she got the promotion.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Candy checked her reflection in her phone. It confirmed what she already knew: she looked amazing.</p>
<p>It had been just over a week since Candy had gotten her promotion. She was sitting at Le Jardin, a bistro that was just expensive enough to keep out the riff-raff. Today she was wearing a powder blue sheath dress. It was sleeveless, showing off her smooth, toned arms. The neckline was actually very conservative, but she’d used Master PC to make sure it hugged her figure just right.</p>
<p>She sipped on a Cosmopolitan. She had to go back to work later, but it was fine. She didn’t need to worry too much about getting a little tipsy. Life as a slut was just so much easier than life as a software engineer.</p>
<p>“Candice?”</p>
<p>Candy looked up. Standing by the table was her best friend, Mia. They’d bonded in college, both being CS majors in a male-dominated field. Mia was just a couple years older, in her early 30s, having been a senior when Candice was a freshman. Mia had stayed for her Master’s Degree, so they’d had a good three years together at college.</p>
<p>Candy began looking her friend over critically, the way she did everyone these days, considering how she might help her with Master PC. God, she was tall. Mia had always been the elegant one of their friend group. She was just over six feet in heels, with a slender frame and a long, graceful neck that reminded Candy of a swan. Today she was wearing a structured navy blazer and tailored trousers that screamed ‘corporate power’ in a way that used to intimidate Candice. Now, Candy just thought she looked constricted.</p>
<p>“Mia! Oh my god, sit down!” Candy squealed, doing a little shimmy in her seat.</p>
<p>Mia didn’t smile immediately. She sat down slowly; her face was etched with concern. </p>
<p>“I didn’t believe the pictures I saw online,” Mia said, her voice carefully neutral.</p>
<p>“Do you like it?” Candy asked, flashing a bright, white smile. “I went blonde! And, you know, made a few other changes.”</p>
<p>“I see that,” Mia said. She ordered an iced tea from the waiter, waving away the menu. Candy ordered a second Cosmo. </p>
<p>Once the waiter left, Mia leaned in, her elbows on the table. “Candice, I wanted to meet because I’m worried about you. I saw the Instagram posts. The ‘Candy’ thing. And now seeing you in person…”</p>
<p>“I’ve never been better! I got promoted, Mia! Senior Director!” Candy beamed.</p>
<p>“That’s great, really,” Mia said. “But Candice, we had lunch two weeks ago. You were… you.” She gestured vaguely at Candy’s body. “You’ve lost so much weight. And your… chest. It’s huge. I never expected you to get breast implants.”</p>
<p>“I’ve always been busty,” Candy said. “They’re not much bigger than they used to be.”</p>
<p>“No offense, Candice, but when you lose weight your breasts get smaller too. I’m not an idiot.”</p>
<p>Oh God, this again. She wished she could just turn on Acceptance for herself, but the documentation was absolutely unclear how it worked if you wanted to affect other people but not the target of the changes.</p>
<p>“I’VE BEEN LOSING WEIGHT FOR A WHILE,” she said. “YOU JUST DIDN’T NOTICE BECAUSE I WAS WEARING MY OLD BAGGY CLOTHES.”</p>
<p>Mia blinked slowly, the way Candy had come to expect when using the Voice.</p>
<p>“No,” she finally said.  “I… I would have noticed that.” She looked confused.</p>
<p>What the hell? That had never happened before. Was Mia resistant somehow? Candice dug down, trying to summon every ounce of energy she could and put it into the Voice. “YES,” she said, “MY LOOK MAKES SENSE. I LOST WEIGHT SLOWLY AND YOU DIDN’T NOTICE.” She felt the resistance from Mia, but was able to push through it. She’d never had this much trouble with the Voice before. She knew it took energy—the documentation said it was harder to use when tired, and excessive use would exhaust your own mental reserves. But she’d used it a lot more than this on River the other day, and it had been fine. She watched Mia carefully, gauging her reaction.</p>
<p>“I… I guess so,” the tall woman finally replied, even though she still looked a little skeptical. “I mean, you couldn’t have actually lost 30 pounds in two weeks. Right?”</p>
<p>Candice breathed a sigh of relief. “Right,” she agreed. </p>
<p>There was a long pause. “So, does Richard like this?” Mia finally asked.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, Da—Richard loves it. A lot of this was his idea, actually.”</p>
<p>“Mmmm,” Mia said noncommittally. “I didn’t think you’d change so much for a guy.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t change for a guy,” Candy countered, waving a perfectly manicured hand dismissively. “I changed for me. I was a boring, fat, invisible engineer. Now I’m a Senior Director. I’m hot. I get what I want. It’s called self-improvement, Mia. You should try it.” She took a large sip of her Cosmopolitan, the alcohol a sweet, fruity rush. “Speaking of which, you look tired. You know, a little more relaxation, a little less stress would do wonders for you.” She was pretty sure there was a “Stress” slider on the Mental tab.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, maybe one day. And Senior Director? How’d you manage that? Aren’t there usually a few steps in between Software Engineer and Senior Director?”</p>
<p>“I think my boss just liked my… enthusiasm,” she answered. “I’ve been helping him with some really long, hard projects.”</p>
<p>Mia’s eyes opened wider. “Oh my God, are you sleeping with him?”</p>
<p>“No!” Candy lied, “Of course not!“</p>
<p>“Oh come on, that was totally a double entendre.”</p>
<p>“Mia, I have a boyfriend.”</p>
<p>“Uh, no, you have a husband. You’ve been married for five years.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” Candice said, “Right. That’s what I meant.” It was easy to forget you were married when you were such a slut.</p>
<p>“What the fuck is going on with you right now?”</p>
<p>“NOTHING! EveRYthING is FinE!” Candice said. She felt the Voice giving out. It was like trying to sing after you’d just been screaming at the top of your lungs. She just couldn’t pull the harmonics together. She needed time to get it back.</p>
<p>“No. It’s not. I’m worried about you.”</p>
<p>Candy floundered, unsure what to say. Tell her about Richard’s software project, the little voice in her head said. Oh yeah, that would work. She still occasionally had smart ideas.</p>
<p>“OK, Mia, look. If you’re worried about me, why don’t you come over tonight?”</p>
<p>“Over where?”</p>
<p>“To my place. Look, Richard and I have been working on something. He’s got a brilliant idea about some Market Analytics software, but he’s no coder. I’ve been trying to help him, but, y’know. You have your Master’s. You know some more theoretical stuff than I do. I’m just… tired, you know. I work hard during the day, and then when I get home it’s more code.”</p>
<p>That should work. Python libraries and API integrations were like catnip to Mia. Candy wouldn’t be surprised if she masturbated to source code. This could kill two birds with one stone. She could get Mia over again tonight so she could make some changes, and get Daddy someone to help him with his project. He had been bringing up his coding idea more and more lately, and there was only so long she could distract him with blowjobs.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Mia said skeptically.</p>
<p>“Great,” Candy said, ignoring her hesitation. “See you at 6:00.”</p>
<p>Candy got up before Mia could protest. She wiggled her ass subconsciously as she walked away.</p>
