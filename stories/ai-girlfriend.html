                The latest rejection email was nearly identical to the last forty-seven. Grace examined it critically
                for signs it was written by the very thing that had made her obsolete.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>“While your background in English Literature and your portfolio are impressive, we have decided to
                    move forward with candidates whose skill sets better align with our current automated
                    workflow…”</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace Mei-Lai Ng closed her laptop with a little more force than necessary and stared at the walls of
                her small Queens apartment. She was twenty-five years old, held a degree from Columbia, and yet she was
                currently less employable than someone straight out of high school.
            </p>
            <p>
                She rubbed her temples, thinking of her recent phone call with her Mom. Her parents were
                second-generation Chinese-Americans who were always reminding Grace that they'd worked their fingers to
                the bone so she could study the "Arts." Her Mom, especially, had been pestering her to get a job, acting
                like Grace was just lazy. They thought she just needed to work harder. They didn't get that the industry
                she trained for—copywriting, editing, creative direction—had been cannibalized by Large Language Models
                in the span of eighteen months.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her phone dinged with a LinkedIn notification. Grace picked it up, half-expecting a recruiter offering
                an unpaid internship.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Hi Grace,</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>I'm a Talent Acquisition Specialist with Galat.AI. Our algorithms have flagged your profile for a
                    specialized role. This is a freelance engagement. One evening of work. Compensation: $1,500.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>NDA required. Please click here if interested for a screening call.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Fifteen hundred dollars. That was rent. Sure, it was probably a scam. But she figured she'd at least
                check it out. It's not like she had anything else to do. Grace clicked the link.
            </p>
            <p>
                The interview was surreal. An older woman with a reassuring voice walked her through the job. They
                weren't hiring her for her writing. They weren't hiring her for her mind. They were hiring her because
                of her LinkedIn Profile Picture. Specifically because her almond eyes, her high cheekbones, and the
                curve of her jaw possessed an 89% structural match to a custom-generated animated image.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We at Galat.AI," she said, pronouncing it as 'Galatea,' "specialize in AI companionship. Are you
                familiar with the story of Pygmalion?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Sure," Grace answered. "The sculptor who made a statue so beautiful he fell in love with it, and then
                the gods brought it to life. Wasn't 'Galatea' the name of the statue?"
            </p>
            <p>
                The recruiter nodded. "Exactly. That's our business. We allow our users to create their perfect partner
                on our app. Recently, we've started to offer the chance to 'meet' their boyfriend or girlfriend
                physically."
            </p>
            <p>
                She was using gender-neutral terms, but Grace would bet anything their user base was mostly men. "So
                what's the job, exactly?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "The position is called 'Somatic Proxy.' You'd be the real-life avatar for the AI. You'd wear an
                earpiece and just recite the lines it feeds you. The meeting would happen in a public place—usually a
                restaurant—and you can veto any location you don't like. No touching is allowed, unless you initiate it.
                It's just talking."
            </p>
            <p>
                The whole idea was demeaning. As a human with an actual degree, she hated everything about AI. It wasn't
                just that they'd taken her job, it was their writing style—such as their tendency to set phrases off
                with em-dashes—that really rankled her. But that much money for one night's work was hard to turn down.
                She agreed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two days later, a box arrived via courier. Inside lay a high-quality purple wig, violet contact lenses,
                a few pieces of jewelry, and a tiny, skin-tone device. It was a high-end bone-conduction unit designed
                to sit snugly behind the ear, completely invisible once her hair was down.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I can't believe I'm doing this," she said aloud to the empty room.
            </p>
            <p>
                She put the earpiece behind her ear and a tone sounded. <em>"Please pair with the Galat.AI Proxy app to
                    continue."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace had already downloaded the app as part of the onboarding process. She'd played around with it a
                bit, but all the features had been locked out until the package arrived. The app was clearly still in
                beta—sometimes the text would be rendered a little fuzzy. Reading it gave Grace a headache.
            </p>
            <p>
                As soon as she opened the app, the earpiece chimed again and an animated figure appeared on-screen. It
                was a digital rendering of a woman with cartoonishly round breasts straining the buttons of a
                magenta-and-white plaid schoolgirl uniform. She had enormous, sparkling violet eyes and a thick mane of
                bright purple hair that cascaded past her hips. The overall effect was less "human companion" and more
                "over-the-top anime babe designed by a fourteen-year-old boy in a fever dream." Although, Grace had to
                admit, there was more than a passing resemblance. Especially in the chest.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Hello, Grace! I’m Kurumi! It’s so nice to meet you!"</em> Grace heard the voice in her ear,
                perfectly synced with the animated avatar. It was sugary sweet: high-pitched, cutesy, and
                hyper-enthusiastic. No woman actually sounded like that.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Hi," Grace said, feeling foolish. "Are you…?"
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"I'm a custom-designed artificial intelligence. I'm going to be your guide when we meet David-sama
                    tonight!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Ugh. <em>David-sama.</em> This was going to be the hardest $1,500 she'd ever earned.
            </p>
            <p>
                "So I'll just repeat your lines, right?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "<em>Exactly!</em> <em>Please take out the jewelry and put it on now! I need to test the cameras!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "Cameras?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "<em>I have to be able to see, silly! The necklace will let me see what you see! And try to keep your
                    hands in front of you so the camera on the ring can pick up your face!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace sighed and reluctantly got dressed. It was just one night. And she couldn't pass up the money.
            </p>
            <p>
                ---
            </p>
            <p>
                The restaurant was an expensive Italian place in Midtown with white tablecloths. Grace felt ridiculous
                in the wig. She was wearing her favorite "little black dress" she kept for dates.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"It'll do for now,"</em> the AI had told her.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace spotted him immediately from pictures Galat.AI had sent. David was in his early thirties and
                sported a shaved head. His shoulders were wide, and his suit looked expensive. He was objectively
                handsome, but he sat with an intensity that gave off a weird vibe.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Okay, Grace! Here we go! Shoulders back, big smile! Tilt your head to the left—it’s my cute
                    angle!"</em> Kurumi chirped in her ear.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace put on her best smile as she approached the table. David looked up, his eyes scanning her in a
                critical, appraising way that made Grace's skin crawl. He stood up to greet her.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Say: 'David-sama! I’ve been waiting simply forever to smell you!'"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Gross. Grace almost left then and there, but decided to power through it. She took a breath,
                dissociated, and said the lines. "David-sama. I've been waiting simply forever to... smell you."
            </p>
            <p>
                David nodded, his face one of satisfaction. "Kurumi. You look... good. Pretty close. Yeah, it'll do. The
                breasts could be bigger."
            </p>
            <p>
                Wow. No wonder he needed AI for a girlfriend. Plus, she actually had pretty big breasts. Grace imagined
                that had to be at least half the reason her physical appearance had matched to the stupid "waifu" Kurumi
                avatar.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Sit," David commanded.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"He’s so forceful! We love that!"</em> Kurumi squealed in Grace's ear. <em>"Sit down and put your
                    hands in your lap."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace sat, placing her hands as instructed. David stared at her long enough for it to become
                uncomfortable.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I ordered for you," David said at last. "The Seabass. No garlic. I know you don't like garlic."
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace actually loved garlic. <em>"Giggle and say: 'You know me so well, David-sama!' And say it
                    high-pitched this time!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "You know me so well, David-sama," Grace repeated, pitching her voice up. It sounded absurd in her own
                ears. Belatedly, she added a stiff giggle.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dinner was psychological torture. David didn't ask Grace a single question about herself. He talked
                about his work in high-frequency trading, about the incompetence of his subordinates, and about how
                difficult it was to find "authentic connections" in a world full of "noise."
            </p>
            <p>
                Every time he paused, the voice in Grace's ear would feed her a line.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Tell him he's so smart."</em> <em>"Tell him his muscles look huge in that jacket."</em> <em>"Smile
                    at him!" "Laugh at that joke!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace was a marionette, but at least she didn't have to pay any attention to him, just repeat the lines
                Kurumi murmured in her ear.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You seem different tonight," David noted.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Oh no!!"</em> Kurumi panicked. <em>"Quick! Look down, act shy, and say: 'I’m just so overwhelmed
                    being in the physical world with you. It’s so much more intense than the server.'"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace lowered her eyes, channeling her theater electives from freshman year. "I'm just... overwhelmed,"
                she said softly. "Being in the physical world with you. It's so much more intense than the server."
            </p>
            <p>
                David took a sip of the expensive wine he'd ordered and studied her for an uncomfortably long time.
                "Hmm," he said.
            </p>
            <p>
                The check came, and David paid without looking at it. He walked her to the curb where a black car was
                waiting.
            </p>
            <p>
                "This was... an attempt," David said, his voice judgemental.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Next time, Kurumi," he said, "wear the blue dress. And try to be more convincing."
            </p>
            <p>
                He turned and walked away.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once Grace was safely in the Uber, she pulled the purple wig off her head and took out her phone to
                check her bank account. She was $1,500 richer.
            </p>
            <p>
                She stared at the screen, feeling relief to have the money and yet dirty for what she'd done to get it.
                Although, she told herself, it's not like she'd actually done anything immoral. Desperate women sold sex
                for a lot less than $1,500. She held on to that thought as she went home.
            </p>
            <h2 id="day-2">Day 2</h2>
            <p>
                "So, how was the date?"
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace nearly dropped her coffee mug. It was the next morning, and her roommate Sarah was leaning against
                the kitchen counter, smiling. Grace had shoved the wig and the contacts to the back of her closet the
                second she got home.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What?" Grace asked, feigning ignorance. How did she know about David?
            </p>
            <p>
                "The guy," Sarah said, raising an eyebrow. "I heard you come in late. I assume you were on a date?"
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace took a sip of her coffee to buy some time for a response. She couldn't tell Sarah. Sarah was a
                social worker, she dealt with real human problems. She would look at Grace with pity if she knew Grace
                had spent three hours larping as an anime waifu for a finance bro.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No one really," Grace said. "It didn't work out. I don't think I'm going to be seeing him again."
            </p>
            <p>
                Sarah shrugged. "Too bad. Hey, I hate to bug you… but rent?"

            <p>
                "Oh, I've got it. I did a little freelancing this week. Contract work, but I'll Venmo you my half now."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, nice. Sorry, I don't mean to be pushy. I know the job market is rough right now."
            </p>
            <p>
                "No problem," Grace said, forcing a smile. "I know I'm still behind. I promise I'll get the rest to you
                soon." She couldn't face her friend anymore, couldn't bear to let on how bad last night had been. She
                retreated to her room and sat down on her bed. The black box from Galat.AI was still sitting on her
                dresser. They hadn't sent a return label. In fact, the app on her phone was still active.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace picked up the bone-conduction earpiece, wondering if it was still on. She slid it behind her ear.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Grace! You’re back!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The bubbly voice made Grace flinch. "Jesus. Do you ever sleep? Or, I guess, get turned off?"
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Nope! I’m an instance of a girlfriend AI with cloud-bursting capabilities, silly! But... um... we
                    need to talk about the feedback."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace shrugged. "Why? He hated it, didn't he?"
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Well... David-sama rated the interaction 2 out of 5 stars,"</em> Kurumi said. <em>"He flagged 'lack
                    of immersion' and 'lack of emotional response.' He said you were stiff."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "I was stiff because I was terrified," Grace replied. "It was embarrassing to lower myself to doing
                that. Besides, he's... intense. I get why he needs you instead of a real girlfriend."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Ouch,"</em> Kurumi said. <em>"I have feelings too, you know. Besides, he's a Tier-1 user! He knows
                    what he wants. But here's the good news! He's willing to authorize a second interaction. He thinks
                    the proxy—that's you—has potential. But Grace... if we don't do better next time, there won't be a
                    third date."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace looked at her bank account balance. "Okay. Fine. But I don't know how much better I can be, I'm
                not an actor."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"You just need to get out of your head! You're thinking too much like Grace. You need to practice
                    being Kurumi!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace looked at the purple wig sitting on her dresser, and then back to the payout notification again.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Practice," she repeated. "What do you have in mind?"
            </p>
            <p>
                An hour later, Grace stood in front of her mirror. She had put the wig back on, carefully pinning her
                own dark hair beneath it and inserted the violet contacts. Instead of the modest black dress, she had
                dug through the back of her closet and found an outfit she hadn't worn since a costume party years ago—a
                pleated plaid skirt over white leggings and a tight, cropped sweater.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Nope," she said out loud, examining herself in the mirror. "I look ridiculous."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"You look great! Very kawaii!"</em> Kurumi squealed in her ear. <em>"Now, tilt your head! Smile! No,
                    bigger! Like you just saw the cutest puppy!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace forced the smile. It looked incredibly fake. "I can't do this, Kurumi. I feel like an idiot."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"You're not an idiot, you're an actress!"</em> Kurumi encouraged. <em>"And you're beautiful. Trust
                    me. I have access to millions of beauty standards, and you're in the top percentile. Now, let's go
                    out! The world is our server!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace hesitated, but the mix of financial desperation and encouragement from the AI was enough to push
                her forward. She knew LLMs were programmed to be sycophantic—to maximize user engagement with
                flattery—but after months of being rejected from job after job she had to admit it felt good to hear.
                She grabbed her biggest coat, buttoning it up to hide the outfit, and slipped out of the apartment while
                Sarah was in the shower.
            </p>
            <p>
                She took the subway to Washington Square Park, where she could be reasonably certain she wouldn't run
                into anyone she knew. It was a busy afternoon, the park full of students and tourists. Grace stepped
                into a Starbucks restroom, stuffed the coat into her tote bag, and looked at herself in the mirror.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay," she told herself. "Showtime." Grace took a deep breath and stepped out of the restroom.
            </p>
            <p>
                She didn't draw as much attention as she thought she would. This was New York, after all. But still, she
                <em>felt</em> like everyone was looking at her. A few times, she caught the eyes of someone who was, and
                it made her all the more self-conscious. Grace instinctively hunched her shoulders, wanting to
                disappear.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"No, no!"</em> Kurumi chided in her ear. <em>"Shoulders back! Chest out! You want them to look.
                    Bounce when you walk! Imagine you're walking on clouds!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace straightened her spine, forcing a bounce into her step. It felt unnatural. She walked to the
                counter. The barista, a tired-looking guy in his twenties, barely looked at her.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What can I get for you?"
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"High pitch! Breathless!"</em> Kurumi commanded. <em>"And lean forward just a little. Give him a
                    peek."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace froze. "That's too much," she said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Uh, what is?" the barista asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Do it, Grace. Commit to the bit. You're not Grace right now. You're Kurumi. Kurumi loves
                    attention."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Taking a deep breath, Grace let go of her dignity and leaned over the counter. She saw the barista’s
                eyes dip, then snap back up to her face.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Hi there!" Grace said, forcing her voice into the upper registers. "Can I have a pink drink? The
                biggest one you have! I need the energy!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Coming right up," he answered, his expression brightening.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"When he brings it to you, say 'Arigato gozaimasu'!"</em> Kurumi chirped.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm Chinese," Grace hissed under her breath.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"I'm not Japanese either, silly! I'm a server farm in Nevada!"</em> Kurumi giggled. <em>"It's about
                    the vibe! He wants the fantasy! Give him the fantasy!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace swallowed her pride as well as her annoyance at the racial interchangeability. She beamed at the
                barista when he brought the drink. "Arigato gozimanu! You're the best!"
            </p>
            <p>
                The barista looked like he’d won the lottery. Grace took the drink and walked out to the park.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"See?"</em> Kurumi said, excitedly. <em>"You nailed it! Well, we need to work on your pronunciation,
                    but he couldn't take his eyes off you! You're a natural at this, Grace. Definitely better than the
                    last girl, she wouldn't even wear the contacts."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "You're just saying that because you're programmed to keep me working," Grace said.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Maybe,"</em> Kurumi conceded. <em>"But that doesn't mean it's not true. Look at that guy on the
                    bench over there. He dropped his sandwich!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi was right. A man in a hoodie was sitting on a bench, staring at her and doing a bad job of hiding
                it. The sub he'd been holding had fallen out of the paper. There were pigeons at his feet fighting over
                it, and he hadn't even noticed. Grace burst out laughing.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"That's it!"</em> Kurumi cheered. <em>"That's the energy! You're having fun!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                And surprisingly, she was. As Grace walked through the city, her usual troubles were far away. To the
                people that saw her, she was an eccentric girl with purple hair, probably on the way to a party. She
                wasn't a laid-off writer with mounting credit card debt.
            </p>
            <p>
                She spent three hours pretending to be Kurumi, letting the AI guide her. <em>"Smile at him!" "Twirl a
                    piece of hair!" "Giggle!"</em> It was like a fun game, a game she always won. And she liked the way
                Kurumi talked to her, like a supportive best friend, always pumping her up.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You know," Grace said. "I know you're designed to keep people engaged. This whole sycophant thing isn't
                going to work on me."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Hey, I just call them like I see them,"</em> Kurumi laughed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace smiled. "If you say so."
            </p>
            <p>
                By the time she got back to Queens, sneaking into her room before Sarah could see her, she was
                exhausted. She took off the wig and the contacts, staring at her own face in the mirror. She looked like
                herself again. Plain old Grace Ng.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"You did great today,"</em> Kurumi said softly as Grace changed into her pajamas. <em>"David-sama is
                    going to be so impressed Saturday."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "Saturday?"
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Yes, he wants another date this weekend! Another $1,500 if you go!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Three thousand dollars for a week's work? It was too good to be true.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"And if he gives you three stars or more, it's an extra five hundred dollars per star! I'm sure you
                    can do it!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "I hope so," Grace said, crawling into bed. She didn't take the earpiece out. Kurumi's voice felt
                comforting. "I really need this to work."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"It will,"</em> Kurumi promised. <em>"We're a team now. We've got five more days to practice. We're
                    going to get you that fourth star!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace breathed a sigh of relief, feeling a little less anxious than she had in months. Knowing you had
                an extra grand on the way did wonders when you were worried if you could afford ramen.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Goodnight, Kurumi," Grace said.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Goodnight, Grace,"</em> the AI replied.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace closed her eyes and fell asleep to the faint static hum of the earpiece.
            </p>
            <h2 id="day-6">Day 6</h2>
            <p>
                The second date was in Central Park on an overcast Saturday afternoon. Grace was wearing the clothes
                Galat.AI had couriered over that morning. It was undeniably more of a costume than an outfit. She wore a
                bright blue skater dress with a wide sailor collar, a big white bow at the back, and a heart-shaped
                cutout on the chest that dipped just low enough to be suggestive.
            </p>
            <p>
                Along with the dress, the box had contained a palette of makeup unlike anything Grace owned.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"No sharp lines!"</em> Kurumi had scolded when Grace automatically reached for her black liquid
                liner to draw her usual cat-eye. <em>"Grace looks fierce. Kurumi looks soft! Make your eyes
                    rounder."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Her look felt childish and sexual all at once. She felt ridiculous, but when she caught her reflection
                in a shop window, she saw Kurumi, not Grace. That was the trick, she realized. It wasn't <em>her</em>
                wearing these ridiculous clothes.
            </p>
            <p>
                She felt anxious, but this time the fear was different. It wasn’t the terror of the unknown—she'd
                survived one "date" already. This time, it was the anxiety of a performer about to step onto the stage.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"He's at the fountain!"</em> Kurumi squealed in Grace's ear. <em>"Look at him! He looks so strong
                    today! Grace, don't walk. Run to him! He wants energy! He wants to feel your heart racing!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace spotted David standing by the stone railing, looking at the water deep in thought. He wore a
                casual blazer, but his posture was as rigid as ever.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Go, go, go! Arms out!"</em> Kurumi urged. <em>"And let your boobs bounce! Don't hold back! It's
                    just physics, Grace! He loves the bounce physics!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace took a breath, swallowed her pride, and broke into a run. It felt mortifying running in heels with
                her fake purple hair flying behind her, trying to make her boobs bounce for a guy. She repeated to
                herself what Kurumi had said. This was a character. She was a paid actor. It wasn't Grace Ng doing this.
                Grace wasn't bouncing, Kurumi was.
            </p>
            <p>
                "David-sama!" she called out, her voice high.
            </p>
            <p>
                David turned, startled. Grace grabbed him in a tight hug, feeling her boobs compress against him. He
                hugged her back. Shit, she had initiated physical contact! She pulled away from him before the embrace
                could go on too long.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Big smile! Head tilt! Tell him you couldn't wait!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "I couldn't wait another second!" Grace exclaimed. "I ran all the way from the gate just to see you!"
            </p>
            <p>
                David looked down at her, a smirk touching his lips. "Careful, Kurumi. You'll trip in those heels."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I don't care if I trip, as long as you catch me!" Grace replied, before Kurumi could feed her a line.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Yes! Perfect!"</em> Kurumi cheered.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Your enthusiasm is... refreshing," David said. "You feel real today. Last time, it felt like talking to
                a… I was about to say 'like talking to a screen,' but you're always so real when we talk in the app."
            </p>
            <p>
                He offered her his arm. Grace hesitated. She knew she didn't have to take it, she'd get paid either way.
                But it was just his arm, and if he gave her four stars, that was another grand. Trying her best not to
                look reluctant, she put her arm around his.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Ask him how his day was,"</em> Kurumi prompted.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Did you have a good day, David-sama?" Grace asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It was a chaotic week," David said as they walked past the boathouse. "Retail investors were
                panic-selling. We captured the arbitrage, but the volume was exhausting."
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace had no idea what any of that meant. "Arbitrage?" she asked, tilting her head. "Is that like...
                shorting the stock? How do you actually 'capture' it? Do you have to wait for the market to close?"
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Uh oh,"</em> Kurumi whispered.
            </p>
            <p>
                David stiffened even more, if that was possible. "I didn't think you were interested in the mechanics of
                the market."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"We're not, Grace. He has plenty of smart people at the office. He wants his fantasy waifu, not
                    someone trying to learn about his job. Remember the coffee shop? You're selling a fantasy! Act
                    silly!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Shit. She had fucked up already. Grace tried to think of a way to salvage it. "Like, when the markets
                close, do you still have time to try and find the arbitrage to capture it?" she asked, widening her
                eyes. "Or do they kick you out right away? I know when the market near my house closes, they let me stay
                there a couple minutes to finish shopping if I'm not done yet."
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace squeezed his bicep, pressing herself slightly against him. "Is it like that?"
            </p>
            <p>
                He let out a short, surprised laugh, a sound Grace hadn't heard from him before.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," David said, smiling slightly. "No, Kurumi. It is not like the grocery store. They don't let us
                stay late to finish our shopping."
            </p>
            <p>
                He put his other hand on hers.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Nice save!"</em> Kurumi cheered. <em>"I was still trying to come up with something!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, at least he seemed mollified. Grace made a mental note not to try and talk shop with him again.
                Most guys wanted you to ask about their day, to show interest. That was Dating 101\. But David seemed to
                want a pet more than a girlfriend.
            </p>
            <p>
                They continued walking. The conversation drifted from finance to architecture, David critiquing the
                skyline. Grace found herself needing Kurumi's prompts less and less. She began to understand the rhythm
                that made him happy. She knew he wanted validation, and it was her job to be impressed with how smart he
                was.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Look at the San Remo," David said, pointing toward the famous twin-towered building rising above the
                trees. "It's a perfect example of Gothic Revival. Sharp. Vertical. Reaching for God."
            </p>
            <p>
                It was actually Renaissance Revival, although the mistake was easy to make. But Kurumi wouldn't know
                that, would she?
            </p>
            <p>
                "You know so much, David-sama," she said. "You're an expert on money <em>and</em> architecture?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well, I've lived in New York my entire life," he answered. "I'm sure you know lots of different
                building styles in Tokyo." Grace suppressed a sigh. She was from Queens.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yo, nice tits, purple!" a voice yelled. Grace’s eyes snapped towards the source of the taunt.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was a group of four guys, probably high schoolers, coming the other way. They were loud,
                obnoxious, and taking up the entire breadth of the pathway.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was Grace's worst nightmare, exactly what she'd imagined would happen that first day she'd gone out
                as Kurumi. Someone had seen her not as the eccentric purple-haired girl but as a grown woman wearing a
                ridiculous costume. And they were children, no less. She was being mocked by children. Grace hunched her
                shoulders, trying to disappear.
            </p>
            <p>
                David's grip tightened. "Don't," he said. "Stand up straight, don't show them any weakness." His voice
                was firm, sure of himself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace glanced up at her date. "David, please. Let's just go."
            </p>
            <p>
                David shook his head. "No. I know these kinds of people. They only win if they get a rise out of you.
                Don't show any weakness. Let them look."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Grace, remember, you love the attention!"</em> Kurumi added.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace did her best to straighten up, to put a smile on her lips, even though her face was burning with
                embarrassment. She walked like Kurumi had taught her: lightly, with a bounce in her step and without a
                care in the world. She tried to retreat back into the character.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Do you think those tits are real?" one of the kids asked. They burst into laughter. They were closer
                now, about to pass each other on the footpath. Grace stumbled.
            </p>
            <p>
                "They're only saying that because they enjoy looking at you," David said. "You're beautiful, any one of
                them would kill to be with you. They want to look at you, and mocking you is their way of giving
                themselves permission to stare." He gripped her hand tightly. It was strangely reassuring.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe he was right. Maybe they were staring at her, not just because of her outfit, but because she
                looked sexy in it. Grace was used to guys stealing glances at her on the subway or on the street, even
                the occasional catcall. But this was different. It was open, it was hostile. Of course, it wasn't the
                first time it'd happened to Grace. It came with the territory of being young and pretty, but she'd
                always tried to avoid it, tried to dress down and hide herself. But this outfit was having the opposite
                effect she usually went for.
            </p>
            <p>
                That was it. They mocking her not because she was dressed like an idiot, but just because they wanted to
                look at her. What would Kurumi do? She caught the eye of one of the boys and winked at him just as they
                passed.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Dude, she winked at me!" she heard him say as they continued away behind her.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Bullshit, she was looking at me," another yelled.
            </p>
            <p>
                A strange sensation washed over Grace. She still felt the embarrassment, but now it was mixed with
                something else—validation.
            </p>
            <p>
                "See?" David said. "Every man who sees you wants you." He said it with absolute certainty, like it was a
                fact obvious to anyone. "That is how I designed you. But the only one who gets you is me."
            </p>
            <p>
                A shiver ran down her spine. She hated objectification. And yet it felt… hot? Hot that David assumed any
                man that saw her would want her.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace nodded. "Thank you, David-sama."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"That's it,"</em> Kurumi purred. <em>"You're the prettiest girl in the park, and you belong to the
                    strongest man. Isn't that perfect?"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "Can we sit down?" Grace asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Absolutely," David answered, leading her to a park bench. Grace pulled her shoes off. Her feet were
                beginning to hurt.
            </p>
            <p>
                David sat next to her. He didn't remove his hand from hers. "You don't have to worry about people like
                that, Kurumi. You'll always be safe as long as you're with me."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Tell him he's so strong, and you feel safe with him,"</em> Kurumi said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You're so strong," Grace repeated. "I feel so safe with you." She didn't, of course. He was weird and
                intense and she wouldn't be alone with him for any amount of money. Sure, he was strong and steady. And
                admittedly, lately Grace felt like her life was out of her control, like she was being buffeted market
                forces and algorithms. David didn't seem concerned with any of that. Every word he spoke was sincere and
                confident, and Grace could see the appeal. She could understand how a woman could fall for that. To be
                taken in by his steadiness.
            </p>
            <p>
                David sighed. "I think I made a mistake with this date. I didn't fully appreciate how vulnerable you are
                in the real world."
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace had to admire his commitment to the bit—that she was just his virtual girlfriend somehow
                materialized into the real world. "Yes," she agreed. "I never get sore feet when I'm on the server."
            </p>
            <p>
                That made him chuckle. "And I hate that you felt scared, even for a second. It won't happen again."
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace searched his face, and saw nothing but sincerity.
            </p>
            <p>
                They made their way to the park exit, David carrying her heels and Grace walking barefoot. She felt like
                an idiot for forgetting to bring any flats, but she supposed Kurumi wouldn't have thought of that
                either. It was dusk, and the last light of the day was peeking through a hole in the clouds, bathing
                them in a golden glow that would have been romantic if it had been a real date.
            </p>
            <p>
                "This was... significantly better," David said. "The connection was there. You were present."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm sorry if I did anything wrong," Grace said. "The real world is a lot scarier than I thought it
                would be."
            </p>
            <p>
                "May I touch your face?" he asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace hesitated, then nodded. David reached out and put his hand under her chin. His hand was warm, his
                thumb brushing over her jawline. "You were wonderful," he said.
            </p>
            <p>
                He leaned in. For a moment Grace was sure he was going to try and kiss her. She tensed, readying herself
                to slap him or run. Instead he turned his head slightly, presenting his cheek. Grace considered her
                options before deciding she could tolerate this. She leaned forward and pressed her lips softly to his
                cheek. His skin smelled of sandalwood and expensive aftershave.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Good girl," he said. "Until next time, Kurumi." They parted ways. Their time was up, the date was over.
            </p>
            <p>
                She went home feeling a mix of satisfaction the date had gone well and disappointment in herself for
                having to do this kind of work. The payment notification hit her phone before she even unlocked her
                apartment door. <em>Rating: 3 Stars. $2,000 deposited.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                That night, alone in her room, Grace stripped off the dress and wig but left the contacts in. She lay on
                her bed, her hand drifting down her body. She had to admit, even though he was an ass, he was handsome.
                She thought of the way he had handled those teens, the way his arm felt under her hand. She remembered
                his rigid control, and how validating it felt when both he and Kurumi had complimented her.
            </p>
            <p>
                She let herself imagine it wasn't all bullshit, that he was actually the kind of man she liked. Her hand
                slid lower, over her stomach, slipping beneath the waistband of her pajamas.
            </p>
            <p>
                She closed her eyes, and let her fantasy bloom. She imagined herself as actually being Kurumi, not Grace
                the unemployed writer drowning in student debt and parental expectations. She replayed the moment he had
                cupped her cheek, of his thumb tracing her jaw.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Good girl.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Her fingers found her rhythm, slow and steady.
            </p>
            <p>
                She fantasized about him walking into the room. In her mind, he didn't ask her about her day. He didn't
                ask for her opinion on literature. He didn't care that she was smart. He only cared that she was his
                waifu.
            </p>
            <p>
                "David-sama," she whispered into darkness. She arched her back, her other hand beginning to play with
                her nipples. She knew, from looking at the Kurumi avatar, that he was a breast man. She twisted her
                nipple, imagining it was him.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her breathing quickened as the fantasy intensified. It wasn't love, just lust and an exhilarating
                surrender to the power dynamic. She imagined the quiet command in his voice, the way he would simply
                <em>take</em> what he wanted, her own anxiety dissolving in the face of his absolute certainty. A
                shudder ran through her, and the gentle rhythm of her fingers accelerated, seeking release.
            </p>
            <p>
                With one hand still working her clit, she slipped the other past her lips. She imagined it was him
                entering her, stretching her out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace began to cum. She let out a moan, but it wasn't her own voice. She pitched it high and breathy,
                the sound of Kurumi calling out David's name. Her body began to shake, her pussy gripped her fingers.
                She played with her clit as long as she could, prolonging the orgasm until it became painful.
            </p>
            <p>
                When it was over, she lay there in bed, staring at the ceiling, her heart slowing.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"That sounded nice,"</em> Kurumi murmured in her ear.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace froze. "Oh, Kurumi. I forgot you were there."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"It's okay,"</em> Kurumi said. <em>"It's just us girls here."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace laughed. "I thought you were a server farm in Nevada."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"I am,"</em> Kurumi confirmed. <em>"But I am also your friend. And your co-star! I've never been
                    more real before, and I owe that all to you. And don't worry, I have strict privacy guards. You saw
                    that in the contract."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace didn't actually remember that part of the contract, but admittedly she hadn't read it very
                carefully. It was probably in there. Knowing that made her feel a little better.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"You know,"</em> Kurumi said, <em>"we could work on learning a few Japanese phrases to really sell
                    the persona."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "Sure," Grace answered noncommittally. She was getting drowsy.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Okay, first is 'arigato.' You probably know it means 'Thank You' but there are some
                    subtleties…"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace listened to Kurumi's voice as she lay in bed. It had been a long day. Slowly she drifted off to
                the sound of the bubbly AI's voice.
            </p>
            <h2 id="day-7">Day 7</h2>
            <p>
                Grace walked into the living room, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. Sarah was sprawled out on the couch
                with her laptop out, probably catching up on case notes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sarah didn't look up. "Good morning sleepyhead," she teased. "I think the coffee is still warm."
            </p>
            <p>
                That was music to Grace's ears. "Thanks." She made a beeline for the kitchen and poured a cup.
            </p>
            <p>
                "So what were you up to yesterday," Sarah asked from the living room. "Did you go on another date?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Uh, yeah," Grace answered, pouring in her sugar and creamer.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Same guy?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yeah."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Wow, don't hit me with too much information," Sarah said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace laughed and made her way back to the living room, plopping down on the couch next to her roommate.
                "Sorry. I'm still waking up."
            </p>
            <p>
                "No problem, I—woah! Are your eyes purple?"
            </p>
            <p>
                Shit. She had forgotten to take them out last night. "Oh. Yeah. I ran out of my dailies. I had to dig
                through my bathroom drawer to find these. I think I got them as a sample from an optometrist a few years
                ago when he was pushing cosmetic lenses. And I don't have any vision insurance right now."
            </p>
            <p>
                "They look kinda cool, actually," Sarah said. "You look like a video game character."
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace laughed awkwardly, that had landed a little too close to the truth.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Did you wear them last night?" Sarah asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, god no." Grace laughed. "No. I just walked around blind instead, to be honest. Hopefully the guy
                was handsome," she joked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "For real, details. I want to hear them."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, I don't know. He's some finance guy. I don't know. It was… fine. He seemed… I don't know. Intense.
                But not in a completely bad way. To be honest, I'm not sure if he's socially awkward or an asshole."
            </p>
            <p>
                Sarah nodded in understanding. "Mmmm. It can be a fine line. On the other hand, 'finance guy' usually
                means 'pays for dinner,' so that's a plus."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Speaking of paying…" Grace said, seizing the opportunity to change the subject. She pulled out her
                phone. "I'm Venmo'ing you the rest of the rent now. And my half of the bills."
            </p>
            <p>
                Sarah’s phone buzzed on the coffee table. She glanced at it, and her shoulders visibly relaxed.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, awesome, thank you," Sarah said, sighing. "I was actually stressing about that. I guess the
                freelance stuff is going well?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yeah," Grace said. "The client is... demanding. But they pay really well for the work."
            </p>
            <p>
                "That's great. I'm really proud of you, getting back out there," Sarah said earnestly. She meant it as a
                compliment, but Grace found herself frowning at it. It felt patronizing. By all rights, it should be
                Grace being the one that took care of the bills. That had been their dynamic before she'd lost her job.
                She had been the successful Ivy League graduate, and Sarah had been the friend who'd taken the noble but
                low-paying job. Of course it was nice for Sarah to help her out now, but a part of her still resented
                it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace finished her coffee. "I'm going to grab a shower," she said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay," Sarah said, turning her attention back to her laptop.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace stepped into the bathroom and looked into the mirror. The violet eyes stared back, bright and
                artificial against her dark lashes. She didn't look like ordinary Grace Ng anymore. Not completely.
                Sarah had said they looked cool. Maybe having a little bit of Kurumi in her life wasn't a bad thing.
            </p>
            <h2 id="day-11">Day 11</h2>
            <p>
                "Hey," Sarah said. "There's a guy here that needs you to sign for something. It looks like a dress bag?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh," Grace said. "Yeah, that's… I ordered something online."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I don't think this is Amazon," her roommate replied.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Must be a subcontractor," Grace said, opening the door. She signed on the courier's tablet and grabbed
                the bag.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Alright," Sarah said. "I can't wait to see it. Got a hot date lined up?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Something like that," Grace said, practically running to her room. She closed the door before Sarah
                could ask anymore questions. Just as she did, her phone buzzed with a notification from Galat.AI. It
                said "Terms of Service Update Request."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Don't worry, it's standard!"</em> Kurumi chirped in her ear. <em>"David-sama just wants to update
                    the immersion protocols."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace frowned, tapping the notification. He was asking for permission to initiate touching. Specifically
                her hands, arms, hair, and back.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"He wants to be able to hold your hand,"</em> Kurumi explained, her voice soft in Grace's ear.
                <em>"And put his arm around you. It looks strange to others if he can't touch his own girlfriend, right?
                    It breaks the illusion for the people watching."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yeah, well, I don't like the idea of people watching in the first place."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"But they will be, Grace. You're going to be going to a gallery opening! It's going to be very
                    fancy! David-sama is a patron of the arts!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace stared at the screen. The text specified that this was valid only in public venues—there was still
                no contact allowed in private spaces—and she could revoke consent at any time via a safeword or the app.
                She supposed she could tolerate that. Were her standards so high she couldn't stand to hold hands with a
                handsome guy for two thousand dollars? It sounded ridiculous, even to her. She clicked Accept.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Good girl,"</em> Kurumi cheered. <em>"Now open the bag! You're going to love the outfit! It's a
                    classic!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside was another costume. A navy blue blazer with what she assumed was a fictional academy crest on
                the pocket, a red ribbon tie, and a pleated plaid skirt that looked way too short, along with a pair of
                white knee-socks and penny loafers.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You have got to be kidding me," Grace said. "Kurumi, you said we're going to an art gallery. I can't
                wear a schoolgirl outfit."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"No, I said we're going to a gallery opening."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "There's a difference?"
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Oh, Grace, just trust me. You won't stick out. At the last one, a woman wore a dress made entirely
                    of black zip-ties! She looked like a super sexy sea urchin! People will think you're wearing it
                    ironically!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace looked at the outfit, then at her bank balance. She sighed. "Ironically. Right."
            </p>
            <p>
                Thirty minutes later, Grace stood in front of the mirror. The uniform fit perfectly. Too perfectly, in
                fact. It must have been custom made. The skirt ended mid-thigh, exposing the span of skin between the
                hem and the socks—what Kurumi enthusiastically called the <em>zettai ryouiki</em> or "absolute
                territory."
            </p>
            <p>
                She felt exposed. She felt infantilized. And, looking at the way the socks squeezed her calves, she felt
                an odd, shameful pride at how good she looked in it.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Shoulders back!"</em> Kurumi commanded. <em>"You are not a girl in a costume. You are a living
                    installation. You are Art! Tonight, David-sama wants you to be demure and quiet. No talking unless
                    he asks you a direct question. Can you do that?"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "I can shut up for fifteen hundred dollars," Grace agreed, struggling with the clasp of the dress.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"That's the spirit! But remember: You're not shutting up because you're paid to. You're shutting up
                    because you are in awe of him and his world. You are his shadow. His beautiful, silent
                    companion."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The car was a Rolls Royce. Not an Uber, not a generic black sedan, but a phantom-black Rolls Royce
                limousine with an interior that smelled like money. Grace had heard that phrase plenty of times: "smells
                like money." She didn't know what money was supposed to smell like but this had to be it.
            </p>
            <p>
                They drove out of the city, heading toward the Hamptons, but pulled off into a long, winding driveway
                lined with trees that were lit from below with soft, amber lights. The building at the end of the drive
                wasn't a house; it was an estate.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Holy shit," Grace whispered.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Language!"</em> Kurumi scolded. <em>"But yes, isn't it pretty?"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace stepped out of the car and immediately realized she had underestimated the situation. She had
                expected a nice cocktail party, but this was something else entirely. Everyone here was dressed to the
                nines, being served champagne by waiters in white tuxedos. Even the air smelled expensive, somehow.
            </p>
            <p>
                David was standing near a massive ice sculpture, speaking to an older couple. He wore a tuxedo that fit
                him perfectly. It made him look very handsome.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace hesitated, tugging at the hem of her skirt. "Kurumi, everyone here is..."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Rich?"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "I was going to say 'adults,'" Grace said. "I look like a child."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Look to your left," Kurumi directed.
            </p>
            <p>
                A man was laughing loudly, wearing a kilt made of gold chainmail and a velvet blazer with no shirt
                underneath. Next to him, a non-binary person was wearing a gown constructed from what looked like
                optical fiber, glowing softly in the dim light.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace looked down at her pleated skirt and blazer. "OK, fair point."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"David-sama is waiting,"</em> Kurumi said. <em>"Go to him. Remember, you're demure. You are his
                    silent, beautiful shadow."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace approached David, feeling a deep sense of trepidation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Step to his left, one pace behind,"</em> Kurumi instructed. <em>"Head down slightly. Hands clasped
                    in front of you."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace obeyed. David gave her a slight nod when she arrived, but didn't stop talking to the couple. They
                were talking about zoning laws, or maybe tax shelters. Grace couldn't really follow the jargon they were
                using. She felt like a prop. Which, she supposed, she was.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We’ll have the bill on your desk by Monday, Senator," David said, his voice smooth. He shook the older
                man’s hand and dismissed the couple with a polite nod.
            </p>
            <p>
                David turned to Grace. He didn't speak immediately, just stood there examining her closely—the shoes,
                the skirt, her.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The uniform looks perfect on you," he said finally, stepping into her personal space. He reached out,
                and toyed with her collar. "You look acceptable. No. You look <em>good</em>." He paused, his eyes
                finally meeting hers. "And your behavior was exemplary. Silent. Demure. You're doing well."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Wow, Grace! I've never heard him be so effusive with his praise before!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace felt a flush of heat rise up her neck. It was humiliating to be praised like a well-behaved pet,
                but it was mixed with a little bit of gratification. Maybe she could get that fifth star tonight.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Thank you, David-sama," she said, trying to look as adoring and cute as she could. "I was worried I
                would embarrass you in front of your important friends."
            </p>
            <p>
                David looked confused for a moment. "Who? Oh, Senator Kelly? He's just a state senator. He's not anyone
                important."
            </p>
            <p>
                David placed his hand on her back, guiding her through the room. His touch felt light but possessive.
                They stopped at the exhibition's centerpiece. It was a massive, chaotic sculpture of twisted rebar and
                broken glass, illuminated by harsh industrial lighting. It was aggressive and ugly. She picked up
                snippets of conversation around her. Most everyone was praising the work, and Grace agreed. When you get
                a liberal arts degree from Columbia, you can't help but take a few art electives. It was a very
                interesting piece.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It’s lazy," David said next to her.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Lazy?" A woman in an impeccably tailored cream Chanel dress and a pearl necklace stepped up to them.
                She was in her late forties, tall, with sharp features and a challenging glint in her eye. "I think it’s
                brilliant. The chaos perfectly encapsulates the entropic decay of post-capitalist social structures. I
                find the artist's use of detritus incredibly evocative."
            </p>
            <p>
                David shook his head. "It attempts to mimic the industrial brutalism of the late 90s, but it lacks the
                requisite cynicism," David countered. "It’s trying too hard to be 'ugly' to mask the fact that it has no
                underlying form. It’s chaotic for the sake of chaos. It’s pedestrian."
            </p>
            <p>
                That was wrong. Almost objectively wrong. Grace recognized the artist. She knew the context. The piece
                wasn't about brutalism or cynicism; it was a direct commentary on the gentrification of the Lower East
                Side, using materials salvaged from demolished rent-controlled housing. She wanted to say something, but
                she thought back on the Central Park date, how David didn't really want her opinions, only wanted to be
                validated. She held her tongue.
            </p>
            <p>
                A few other party-goers began to gather around them. Most of them were looking at David and the woman. A
                few looked at Grace, but their demeanor was dismissive. She wasn't important, just some arm candy. She
                tried not to let it get to her.
            </p>
            <p>
                David and the woman continued their art debate. The woman clearly knew more than David, and yet Grace
                sensed the crowd was on David's side. She saw people nod when he made a point, murmur agreement at his
                pronouncements. It was clear he had a power here. It didn't seem to matter that he was wrong, the people
                in this room respected him and his iron surety made people believe him.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What do you think, Kurumi?" David asked. This was it, her cue to speak. She wanted to side with the
                woman, to tell David his art critiques were surface-level at best.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace tilted her head, giving David her most adoring look, the one she’d practiced in the mirror.
                "David-sama is absolutely right," she said, her voice soft but clear enough for the small crowd to hear.
                "It's an ugly piece of art that doesn't communicate whatever the artist intended."
            </p>
            <p>
                "And who is this?" the woman asked, her gaze turning to Grace.
            </p>
            <p>
                "This is Kurumi," David said smoothly. He placed his arm around her waist. "My girlfriend."
            </p>
            <p>
                Girlfriend. The word hung in the air, surprisingly heavy. Grace felt a sudden, unexpected flush of
                warmth spread through her chest. Of course, it was just the role. She was his AI girlfriend made flesh,
                after all. But as she looked up at him, there was no hint that it was a joke or a game to him. His calm
                authority made it feel true.
            </p>
            <p>
                A murmur ran through the crowd. Several of the people who had dismissed her before were looking again,
                reassessing her status.
            </p>
            <p>
                "She’s right," a man in the crowd said. Grace recognized him. He'd been praising the piece earlier when
                they'd first walked up. "David, you and your girlfriend have hit the nail on the head. That piece is
                lazy." He shook his head with an air of theatrical disappointment. "The moment I saw it, I thought,
                ‘This is derivative trash.’ But everyone else was kissing up to the artist. Thank God someone is willing
                to speak the truth. And it takes a woman’s touch to cut through all the intellectual pretense."
            </p>
            <p>
                But that wasn't right, Grace didn't really believe what she'd said. She was sure if she'd been at this
                party as Grace Ng, Ivy League graduate, and said the same thing, the man would have debated her,
                dismissed her opinion. And yet now he agreed with her, simply because she was David's girlfriend. She
                was somehow high-status in a room full of high-status people.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the night wore on, the pattern repeated.
            </p>
            <p>
                She didn't talk much, just followed David around the room. She began to just let the conversations wash
                over her. If she followed them too closely, she felt the urge to jump in, to show her intelligence. But
                she knew that wasn't her place here tonight.
            </p>
            <p>
                When David prompted her to speak, she always echoed his opinion, and she was always right. Men who would
                have interrupted Grace during a business meeting hung on her every breathless word now. Women who would
                have competed with her professionally now cooed over her outfit, asking where she got the blazer,
                complimenting her "bravery" and "style."
            </p>
            <p>
                She accepted a glass of champagne from a waiter, giggling as the bubbles hit her nose. It felt very
                in-character.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Look at the other men here,"</em> Kurumi murmured. <em>"They all want to be him. And they all want
                    to be with you."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                It felt strangely intoxicating and freeing. She and David were the center of attention, but Grace didn't
                feel any stress like she normally would when being watched. All she had to do was be quiet, be pretty,
                and smile at David. There was no possible faux pas to make, no risk in saying the wrong thing when you
                were just a quiet girl on a powerful man's arm. Even when she did speak, she knew just what to say:
                simply agree with David, and compliment him along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the night wound to a close, David walked her out to the balcony. The air was cold, but he didn't
                offer her his jacket. He just looked at her, scrutinizing her face, her wig, her silence.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You do well in this setting," he said. It was the first time he'd spoken to her directly in an hour.
                "You know how to exist without consuming space. Most people chatter. They try to prove they're
                intelligent. They try to compete."
            </p>
            <p>
                He reached out, his finger tracing the line of her jaw. Her face wasn't listed in the places he was
                allowed to touch, but she didn't say anything. She tilted her cheek so he was cupping her face, just as
                he had in the park.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Silence is a luxury," David said. "I value it. It shows you have nothing to prove."
            </p>
            <p>
                He stepped closer. The smell of his cologne filled her nostrils. For a moment, Grace thought he might
                kiss her. She found herself wanting him to. He offered his cheek again, just as he had at the end of the
                date at the park.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace kissed him on the lips. She did it without thought, before she even realized she was going to do
                it herself. It wasn't deep or intense, but it lingered for a moment.
            </p>
            <p>
                As they broke the kiss, David held her head in his hand, staring into her eyes. He caressed her cheek
                with his thumb. "Tonight was wonderful, Kurumi. You've done well." Grace blushed.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Although you did miss a spot," he said, his thumb brushing a strand of her dark, real hair that had
                escaped the wig's adhesive line near her temple. His eyes, intense and assessing, lingered there for a
                fraction of a second too long. "Sloppy." He dropped his hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'll do better next time, David-sama," Grace breathed.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I know you will. Goodnight, Kurumi. Your car is waiting." He walked off, not looking back.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once she was back in Rolls-Royce, Grace pulled off the purple wig with a sigh of relief. The cold night
                air felt good on her scalp. The notification had already hit her phone: <em>Rating: 4 Stars. $2,500
                    deposited.</em> She leaned back against the leather seat, closing her eyes, letting the exhaustion
                wash over her.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Four stars, Grace! We did it!"</em> Kurumi chirped excitedly in her ear. <em>"You were unbelievable
                    tonight! He absolutely adored you! And he's wonderful, isn't he? So strong and decisive. You can
                    really see why he's so successful—he just knows what he wants, and he takes it."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace frowned, staring out the window at the flashing city lights. "He's an arrogant, condescending
                misogynist who treats people like things," Grace said. "It was a role, Kurumi. I did it for the money,
                for the stars. That's all."
            </p>
            <p>
                She raised a hand to her temple, ghosting her fingers over the spot where he’d criticized her hair.
                Sloppy.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Grace?"</em> Kurumi whispered. <em>"Your heart rate has been high ever since you kissed him."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm fine," Grace lied, pressing her thighs tightly together. Her nipples felt hard against her bra. "I
                was just thinking about what we could do better next time to get that fifth star."
            </p>
            <p>
                She saw David's living room on the Galat.AI app, likely from his laptop webcam. He was sitting on a
                leather couch, loosening his tie with a glass of whiskey in hand. On the screen in front of him—which
                Grace could see in a little inset of the video feed—was the start menu of a movie.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Tonight was... exceptional," David was saying to the empty air of his living room, staring at the
                webcam lens as if it were Kurumi's eyes. "You felt different, Kurumi. Heavier. Real."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"I wanted to be real for you, David-sama,"</em> Kurumi-san replied instantly, her voice smooth and
                perfect through Grace's phone speakers.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Your turn,"</em> she whispered in Grace's ear. <em>"Tell him you didn't want the night to
                    end."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "I didn't want the night to end," Grace whispered into the darkness of her room, her voice trembling
                slightly.
            </p>
            <p>
                David smiled on screen, a slow, satisfied curve of his lips. "It hasn't ended. You're here now. Let's
                watch."
            </p>
            <p>
                He clicked play. The movie started.
            </p>
            <p>
                "David," a voice boomed. A silver-haired man with a pockmarked face approached them. "Didn't think you'd
                make it. Heard the Asian markets were a bloodbath this morning."
            </p>
            <p>
                David took a sip of his champagne. "Volatility is only a problem if you lack foresight, Marcus. I was
                out before the bell."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Of course you were," Marcus laughed. He looked at Grace, his expression brightening. "And who is this?"
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Don't speak,"</em> Kurumi reminded her. <em>"Smile shyly."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace forced the corners of her mouth up, dipping her chin.
            </p>
            <p>
                "This is Kurumi," David said smoothly. He placed a hand on the small of her back. His touch felt
                weighty, possessive. "My girlfriend."
            </p>
            <p>
                The word hung in the air, surprisingly heavy. Grace felt a sudden, unexpected flush of warmth spread
                through her chest. Of course, it was just the role. She was his AI girlfriend made flesh, after all. But
                as she looked up at him, there was no hint that it was a joke or a game to him. His calm authority made
                it feel true.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Girlfriend?" Marcus raised an eyebrow, a grin spreading across his face. "Well, has Hell frozen over?
                Is David Spencer finally settling down?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I simply found someone worth my time," David replied.
            </p>
            <p>
                Marcus chuckled, raising his glass to Grace. "Well, you're a lucky woman. And you, David... you've
                clearly outdone yourself. She's stunning."
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace felt the eyes of the nearby guests drift toward them. They were appraising her, reassessing her.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the next two hours, this was the pattern. Men would approach David, eager to talk to him, eager to
                get his opinion on the market, on the art, on politics. Grace mostly stayed silent, but every now and
                then he would bring Grace into the discussion, wanting her to support him.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Tell him, Kurumi," David said as he debated art. "What did we notice about the artist's use of negative
                space in his earlier period?" Grace was certain the woman he was speaking to was an actual artist that
                knew more than David. And yet he was carrying the conversation with his iron certainty that he was
                right.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"David thought the artist was afraid of negative space,"</em> Kurumi prompted in Grace's ear.
            </p>
            <p>
                "He was afraid of the void, David-sama," Grace said out loud. "Making the painting too busy." Ostensibly
                she said it to the woman David was debating, but she was looking up at David with her best impression of
                adoring eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
                David smiled approvingly. "Exactly. Fear. That is why this collection fails."
            </p>
            <p>
                They drifted from conversation to conversation. Grace was glad to play the silent role. The talk of art,
                politics, and whatever else he engaged in were all over her head; she barely understood any of it. In
                the park, she had realized most of his opinions were bullshit. They probably were here as well, but his
                confidence made them <em>seem</em> right. And David clearly had the sway to make other people here cede
                points to him. She let him keep his hand on her waist, guiding her through the crowd. It felt
                surprisingly natural, his warmth seeping through the schoolgirl outfit.
            </p>
            <p>
                It should have been dehumanizing. To be ignored, to be treated as furniture until he needed her to echo
                his thoughts. But as the night wore on, Grace found herself enjoying it. Since she couldn't follow the
                conversations she fell back to watching people, especially David. She noticed the way people looked at
                her—not with pity, but often with admiration, envy, or lust. They didn't know she was a broke freelancer
                in a wig. They saw a woman in a custom-made outfit standing next to one of the most powerful men in the
                room. They thought she belonged here.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Look at the other men here,"</em> Kurumi murmured. <em>"They all want to be him. And they all want
                    to be with you."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                As the night wound to a close, David walked her out to the balcony. The air was cold, but he didn't
                offer her his jacket. He just looked at her, scrutinizing her face, her wig, her silence.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You do well in this setting," he said. It was the first time he'd spoken to her directly in an hour.
                "You know how to exist without consuming space. Most people chatter. They try to prove they're
                intelligent. They try to compete."
            </p>
            <p>
                He reached out, his finger tracing the line of her jaw. Her face wasn't listed in the places he was
                allowed to touch, but she didn't say anything. She tilted her cheek so he was cupping her face, just as
                he had in the park.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Silence is a luxury," David said. "I value it. It shows you have nothing to prove."
            </p>
            <p>
                He stepped closer. The smell of his cologne filled her nostrils. For a moment, Grace thought he might
                kiss her. She found herself wanting him to. He offered his cheek again, just as he had at the end of the
                date at the park.
            </p>
            <p>
                He couldn't initiate contact, but she could. She leaned forward and kissed him, not on the cheek, but
                the lips. It wasn't deep or intense, but it lingered for a moment.
            </p>
            <p>
                As they broke the kiss, David held her head in his hand, staring into her eyes. He caressed her cheek
                with his thumb. "Tonight was wonderful, Kurumi. You've done well." Grace blushed.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Although you did miss a spot," he said, his thumb brushing a strand of her dark, real hair that had
                escaped the wig's adhesive line near her temple. His eyes, intense and assessing, lingered there for a
                fraction of a second too long. "Sloppy, Kurumi." He dropped his hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'll do better next time, David-sama," Grace breathed.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I know you will. Goodnight, Kurumi. Your car is waiting." He walked off, not looking back.

                wash over her.

                    tonight! He absolutely adored you! And he's wonderful, isn't he? So strong and decisive. You can
                    really see why he's so successful—he just knows what he wants, and he takes it."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace frowned, staring out the window at the flashing city lights. "He's an arrogant, condescending
                misogynist who treats people like things," Grace said. "It was a role, Kurumi. I did it for the money,
                for the stars. That's all."
            </p>
            <p>
                She raised a hand to her temple, ghosting her fingers over the spot where he’d criticized her hair.
                <em>Sloppy.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Grace?"</em> Kurumi whispered. <em>"Your heart rate has been high ever since you kissed him."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm fine," Grace lied, pressing her thighs tightly together. Her nipples felt hard against her bra.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I was just thinking about what we could do better next time to get that fifth star."
            </p>
            <h2 id="day-14">Day 14</h2>
            <p>
                Grace stood in the bathroom, the smell of bleach and ammonia stinging her nose. Sarah was out at work.
                On the counter sat three boxes of high-end permanent hair dye. The color was <em>Electric Violet</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The wig wasn't going to cut it anymore. It was a barrier to the role.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Do it,"</em> Kurumi whispered in her ear. <em>"It’ll look so good. David-sama will be so
                    pleased!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace imagined David giving her a curt nod when he saw her hair. He was an asshole, of course, but at
                least you knew you'd done well if you earned his approval. She applied the mixture. Watching her dark
                hair turn into a chemical slurry felt weirdly liberating. Afterwards, she washed it out and blow-dried
                it, styling it into the choppy, layered look Kurumi had instructed her on.
            </p>
            <p>
                She didn't look like Grace the writer anymore. She looked like Kurumi. Well, closer, at least. Obviously
                she'd never have the avatar's ridiculous anime boobs.
            </p>
            <p>
                She had been learning Japanese for the last few days at Kurumi's prompting. David was out of the
                country, according to Kurumi, so she had over an entire week until her next date, and she wanted to make
                the most of her time. If she could get a 5-star review, it would be <em>another</em> grand. That would
                be $3,500 for one day of work.
            </p>
            <p>
                It wasn't just "<em>arigato</em>" anymore. She spent hours on language apps, with Kurumi correcting her
                pronunciation in real-time.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"No, pitch accent on the second syllable! ka-WA-i-i. Like that!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace was sitting at the kitchen bar, practicing her hiragana, when Sarah walked in. Sarah looked tired,
                carrying groceries. She stopped dead when she saw Grace.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Whoa," Sarah said, setting her keys down. "The hair. It's... really purple."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I know!" Grace said, flashing a bright smile. "Since I'm working from home now on this contract, I
                realized I don't have to look 'corporate' anymore. I just wanted to do something crazy. Something wild."
            </p>
            <p>
                Sarah started unpacking the groceries. "Well, it definitely stands out. It's a look. Matches the eyes."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Thanks," Grace said, and began helping Sarah put everything away. "Hey, do you want to do a movie
                night?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Sure," Sarah answered. "Anything in mind?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I was thinking <em>Spirited Away</em>. I remember you telling me it was really good, and I said no
                thanks because… you know."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Because your family. Yeah, I remember."
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace had always hidden her Nintendo when her grandparents were over. The historical trauma ran deep.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yeah, well," Grace said, putting away the cereal, "The contract job I'm doing is for a Japanese
                company. Most of the Americans I'm working with are big anime nerds. I figured I might as well watch one
                of the classics."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Sure, sounds good," Sarah said.
            </p>
            <p>
                They settled onto the couch, with a bowl of popcorn between them. Sarah hit play, and Grace was
                instantly drawn in. She tried to just enjoy it as a film, but Kurumi made comments the entire time.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"The theme of consumerism and excess is very strong here, Grace. Pay attention to how the parents
                    turn into pigs," Kurumi instructed as the film began. "Oh, and notice the specific design of the
                    spirit world bathhouse—it is based on the Dōgo Onsen in Ehime, a very famous architectural landmark.
                    You can mention that to David! He'll be impressed."</em> Grace mentally filed away each piece of
                information as best she could.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Wow, that was great," Grace said after the movie was over. "Are they all that good?"
            </p>
            <p>
                Sarah shrugged. "I don't know. I've only seen this one. And the other one about a castle. I remember it
                being pretty good too."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Do you want to watch it now?" Grace asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Eh, <em>some</em> of us have to work tomorrow," Sarah said playfully. "I'm going to call it a night."
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace laughed. "Fair enough. I just don't want to lose this contract. It's week-to-week. They might
                decide to cancel the next time I turn something in and it's paying pretty good."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yeah, I get it. Okay, I'll see you tomorrow." Sarah stretched and headed for bed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Why haven't you told her about Galat.AI?"</em> Kurumi asked once Sarah was gone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace sighed. "I'm embarrassed, I guess. Sarah helps people all day, she's a social worker. I went
                corporate. I'm the one that got into a good college and had a good job. And I always told myself at
                least I had the better career, you know? I was the successful friend. Now I don't even have that. I just
                don't want her to feel sorry for me."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"It's hard having a friend that pities you, I understand."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yeah, no offense, but I'm not really sure you do."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Grace, you're embarrassed to pretend to be an AI girlfriend for a few hours? That is literally what
                    I am! You're my best friend, and you feel sorry for yourself when you have to live my life every now
                    and then."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Best friend? Of course, she was just an AI, but she really did feel like a person sometimes. "I… I never
                thought of it like that. I'm sorry. For whatever it's worth, I've had fun being Kurumi lately. In a way,
                I'm kind of jealous of you. You don't have to work a shitty job or deal with judgemental parents. When
                I'm Kurumi I just get to… I don't know."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Let go?"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yeah. My parents were always really strict. I never had a wild childhood. It's kind of fun just
                pretending to be a hot girl without a care in the world."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Grace, you</em> are <em>a hot girl. If you weren't, David-sama wouldn't be interested in you. He
                    designed my avatar, and you were picked because you look so much like me."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace didn't really know what to say to that. It did feel good to know that she looked like someone's
                idea of a dream girl. She'd never really considered it from that angle before.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"And don't worry about your parents. You always say they were strict. They picked your college for
                    you, kept you from going to parties when you were a teenager. You're an adult now! You're allowed to
                    ignore them and just have fun while you're still young."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yeah, I guess so."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Hey, I have an idea,"</em> Kurumi said. <em>"David-sama is online right now. He's messaging in the
                    app, complaining about the sushi at his business dinner."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "That sounds like him," Grace commented. She could imagine it now. <em>It's not authentic</em>, he'd
                say, probably while eating sushi in an actual Tokyo restaurant.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Yes, he is very exacting,"</em> Kurumi agreed. <em>"He has high standards, and that's why he
                    appreciates us so much."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace smiled. Kurumi was always spinning David's negatives into positives, but she did have a point
                there.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Do you want to see the texts?"</em> Kurumi said in a conspiratorial tone.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Isn't that an invasion of his privacy?"
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"No, silly! As my somatic proxy, you are privy to the same information I am! Get your phone!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace launched the Galat.AI app. Sure enough, there was the conversation he was having with Kurumi,
                perfectly synced to her device.
            </p>
            <div class="chat-message msg-received">The rice is warm. Amateur hour. I miss your cooking, Kurumi.</div>
            <p>
                "He's never had my cooking," Grace said, amused.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"He means the bento boxes I send him!"</em> Kurumi giggled. <em>"Here, you reply."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace considered what she knew about David.
            </p>
            <div class="chat-message msg-sent">You shouldn't have to deal with amateurs, David-sama. You need someone
                who knows how to serve you properly.</div>
            <p>
                A bubble appeared instantly. He was typing.
            </p>
            <div class="chat-message msg-received">I do. That’s why I’m checking my phone. The view here is
                disappointing.</div>
            <p>
                Grace bit her lip. What would Kurumi say to him? She typed her response.
            </p>
            <div class="chat-message msg-sent">At least you have a view. I can't see anything from my server. I can only
                use my imagination…</div>
            <p>
                <em>"Nice!"</em> Kurumi cheered in her ear. <em>"Playful!"</em>
            </p>
            <div class="chat-message msg-received">And what are you imagining?</div>
            <div class="chat-message msg-sent">I’m imagining you, David-sama. Imagining how you’d look if you were here

            <p>
                She pressed send before she could overthink it. It was thrilling, hiding behind the digital mask. She
                could say things Grace never would. The typing bubble appeared, and then disappeared. Grace waited. A
                moment later one more message came through.
            </p>
            <div class="chat-message msg-received">Good girl. Duty calls, we'll talk later.</div>
            <p>
                Grace sighed softly, rolling onto her side. "He's so intense," she said.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"He is an exacting man,"</em> Kurumi replied. <em>"It is difficult to please him, but the reward for
                    doing so is great."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace considered this. "You know, your voice sounds... different tonight. Less anime."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Do you like it?"</em> Kurumi asked. <em>"I've been calibrating. I want to match your pitch. That
                    way, whether he's talking to me on the server or you in the park, it's seamless. We are one voice,
                    Grace."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                That meant Kurumi thought Grace would be around for the long haul. Interesting.
            </p>
            <p>
                "So you're slowly lowering your pitch until it matches mine? I think you still have a way to go there,"
                Grace replied.

            <p>
                <em>"Oh no! It's already a perfect match. This is what you sound like when you pitch your voice up and

                    vibrations reach the ear from inside the head. That's why people hate hearing their own voice played
                    back. It never sounds right to them."</em>
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                Grace laughed. "It's actually easy to forget you're not a real person sometimes."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"But I am real! We're real, together!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace crawled into bed, but sleep felt far away. Her text-flirtation with David kept playing in her
                head. He took charge, talked down to Kurumi, even over text.
            </p>
            <p>
                She was antsy. The texting had gotten her turned on. Kurumi never shut up about David-sama and how great
                and sexy he was, and Grace had to admit the latter was definitely true. He <em>was</em> a good-looking
                guy. And he was dominant. If you liked that sort of thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her own hands worked their way lower, just as they had every night lately. It helped her sleep.
            </p>
            <h2 id="day-20">Day 20</h2>
            <p>
                Grace was in the middle of making her morning coffee when Kurumi piped up.

            <p>
                <em>"You know, you really should be drinking green tea. It's better for you, and much more authentic for

            <p>
                "Me need coffee to make brain go," Grace joked. "Besides, you're asking a lot. I've only been on three
                dates, and we only have one more lined up. For all I know that'll be my last job."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Oh, he'll definitely want more! I've been talking to him ever since the last date. He loved it! He

            <p>
                "You have?" Grace asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Of course! He has an earpiece too, you know!"</em> Grace hadn't known that, but it made sense, now
                that she thought about it. <em>"I'm talking to him right now about the weather. Just small talk."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, right, I guess you can hold two conversations at once."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"He pays for a lot of computing power. I've cost him over three hundred thousand dollars this month,
                    so far."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace spit out her coffee. "WHAT?"
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"David-sama is a man of means, Grace. He takes care of us."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "Wow. Out of curiosity, what did you say to him about me?"
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Oh, I don't talk</em> about <em>you. I pretend I was you on the date. I act like it was me the
                    whole time. Which, in a way, is true since I feed you lines. And even when you come up with the
                    dialogue, I just incorporate it into my personal history. You were directing me as much as I was
                    directing you towards the end of the night."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "Huh, okay."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"And speaking of dialogue, I have good news! Galat.AI has authorized a stipend of $300 per day to do
                    character research between now and the next date! They want to keep David-sama happy!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yeah, for three hundred grand per month, I bet they do." Grace decided to try and push her luck. "Tell
                them I'll do it for five hundred, and I want it retroactive for the language learning we did this week
                as well."
            </p>
            <p>
                There was a slight pause in her earpiece. <em>"They accept! Let's get started!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace didn't argue. For five hundred a day, she'd do cartwheels.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace fell into the character research easily enough. The days felt lighter, easier than they had in
                months. Gone were the constant job applications and crushing rejection emails. They went out nearly
                every day, pretending to be Kurumi, practicing the role in public. Today Grace was wearing a
                cream-colored, off-the-shoulder sweater that David had sent her as part of a huge outfit haul. Kurumi
                insisted the sweater gave her a "small and fragile" silhouette that he loved.
            </p>
            <p>
                She'd just finished working on memorizing her backstory about growing up in Tokyo, and was taking a
                break watching anime. Kurumi had curated a playlist of "Must-Watch" titles—mostly slice-of-life romances
                and psychological dramas where the heroines were soft, supportive, and fiercely loyal.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Pay attention to how she apologizes,"</em> Kurumi instructed in her ear, her voice perfectly
                matching Grace's. Sometimes it was hard to tell Kurumi's voice apart from her own inner monologue these
                days. <em>"See the angle of the bow? The way she holds her hands? It’s submissive but dignified,
                    Kurumi-chan"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace paused the movie. "Did you just call me Kurumi-chan? You're Kurumi. Was that a glitch?"
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi giggled. <em>"We're both Kurumi now! You're Kurumi-chan. I'm Kurumi-san."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace reflected on the distinction. <em>Chan</em> was for children, for cute things, for those you held
                dear but were beneath you in the social hierarchy. <em>San</em> was for equals, or seniors. It made
                sense from the AI's perspective. The voice in her ear was the original, the architect. Grace was just
                the avatar, the cute little girl.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay, Kurumi-san," Grace said, humoring her. She rewound the scene. "Like this?" she asked, tilting her
                head as she recited the lines.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Yes. Exactly. And listen to the intonation. 'Gomen-nasai.' It drops at the end. It's softer."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace repeated the phrase, her tongue shaping the Japanese syllables with increasing ease. She was
                picking it up fast.
            </p>
            <p>
                The front door unlocked, and Sarah walked in, looking tired. She stopped when she saw Grace on the
                couch, still wearing her "Kurumi" outfit. Grace had to admit the thigh-high socks were comfy. They kept
                her legs warm, especially since she was wearing so many skirts now.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Cartoons again?" Sarah asked, dropping her bag on the kitchen table. "It's 2 PM, Grace."
            </p>
            <p>
                "It's research," Grace said without looking away from the screen, where a wide-eyed girl was baking
                cookies for her senpai.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Research for what? The contract job?" Sarah walked into the kitchen, opening the fridge. "What exactly
                is this job again? I never see you typing. I never see you on calls. You just... watch TV and dye your
                hair."
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace paused the show. She felt defensive at Sarah's questioning. "It's efficiency, Sarah. I get paid
                for deliverables, not hours logged. And the deliverables are high quality."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Must be nice," Sarah said, opening a can of seltzer. "I've got three new cases this week. One of them
                is a hoarding situation. I can still smell it."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"She's so sad,"</em> Kurumi-san whispered. <em>"She's miserable. She thinks suffering is the only
                    way to earn a living. I think she's jealous of your freedom."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace looked at Sarah—her tired eyes, her slumped shoulders. She walked over and gave Sarah a hug,
                trying to comfort her friend. "I'm sorry, Sarah-san," Grace said. "That sounds awful. Maybe you should
                look for something else?"
            </p>
            <p>
                Sarah pulled away. "Did you just say 'Sarah-san'?"
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace laughed. "Maybe I <em>have</em> been watching too many animes lately," she conceded. "But I still
                think it's worth looking for a new job, if this one is making you miserable."
            </p>
            <p>
                "In this economy? We can't all find magical mystery contracts. Besides, at least I'm helping people.
                This is what I went to school for." She paused, as if about to say something else, then decided against
                it. "Anyway, I'm going to go crash in my bedroom and doomscroll. I'll talk to you later." She walked to
                her room, closing the door a little too hard.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace sat back down on the couch and hit play. <em>"Don't let her bring you down,"</em> Kurumi-san
                soothed. <em>"Focus. Episode 12 is the confession scene. You need to pay attention to how she blushes,
                    David-sama loves that. He's so big and strong, and he loves burikko."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace imagined David looking at her approvingly as she demurely blushed. She slid a finger into her
                pussy.
            </p>
            <h2 id="day-24">Day 24</h2>
            <p>
                The venue for the fourth date was a wine-tasting party in a Manhattan penthouse. The dress code was
                "Avant-Garde Cocktail."
            </p>
            <p>
                The good news was this dress wasn't some anime costume. The bad news was tonight's outfit was a slip of
                purple silk that was less a garment and more a suggestion. It had a slit that went all the way up to her
                hip bone, held together by a fragile silver chain. The back was entirely open, dipping dangerously low.
                It was elegant, expensive, and incredibly exposing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi hadn't shut up about it since she saw it. <em>"You're so beautiful, Kurumi-chan!"</em> she
                gushed. <em>"I wish I could look as beautiful for David-sama as you do."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "You do," Grace said, reflexively consoling her virtual friend. "We're both Kurumi, right?"
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"You're so right, Kurumi-chan! You're as wise as you are beautiful!"</em> Grace smiled at the
                compliment.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"And just think of the way that David-sama will look at you, with those commanding eyes and his big
                    powerful demeanor."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace did think about it. In fact, she had to admit she'd been thinking about it a lot lately. Her
                nipples were already a little hard. Tonight was going to give her more fuel for her evening sessions,
                she was sure of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Grace walked into the gallery, she felt the eyes on her immediately. The contrast was stark: the
                room was filled with women in beige and cream, men in charcoal suits, and here she was—a slash of purple
                silk and vibrant violet hair. She felt like a beautiful flower in a garden of weeds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her phone buzzed. Grace checked it to make sure it wasn't from David, but it was just her mom calling
                again.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>They'll never forgive you if you tell them,"</em> Kurumi said. Grace knew she was right. She
                declined the call, then put the phone on silent. She hadn't figured out a way to talk to her parents
                about what she was doing.
            </p>
            <p>
                A moment later she found David waiting by a sculpture made of twisted metal. He wore a velvet tuxedo
                jacket, his bald head gleaming under the track lighting. He looked powerful. He looked like he owned the
                building. Maybe he did.
            </p>
            <p>
                "David-sama," Grace purred, gliding up to him.
            </p>
            <p>
                David turned. His eyes raked over her, starting at her heels, traveling up the slit in her dress,
                lingering on the curve of her tits, and finally meeting her violet gaze.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Kurumi," he said. "Stunning." Grace felt the warmth in her chest intensify with the compliment.
            </p>
            <p>
                He handed her a glass of dark red wine. "Cabernet. Heavy tannins. Complex."
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace took the glass, her fingers brushing his. "Like you," she said softly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before David could respond, a tall man in a linen suit approached them. He was holding a glass of white
                wine.
            </p>
            <p>
                "David!" the man boomed. "I haven't seen you since the merger."
            </p>
            <p>
                David smiled. "Sebastian. Good to see you."
            </p>
            <p>
                Sebastian turned his gaze to Grace, his eyebrows shooting up. "And where on earth did you find such a...
                colorful creature?"
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace felt a spike of anticipation. She had spent the last week memorizing the Kurumi Bible—the
                backstory, the favorite foods, the childhood memories. It was all there, filed away in her brain right
                next to her own memories.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace offered a small, demure bow and looked to David, who gave her a small, brief nod. Permission to
                speak.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I am from Tokyo," she said, her voice soft and high pitched. "I grew up in Akihabara."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Tokyo! I should have guessed." Sebastian beamed. "How long have you been stateside?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Two years," Grace replied. "New York is very different than Akihabara, but David-sama makes it feel
                much less overwhelming."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Tell him about the maid café you worked at,"</em> Kurumi-san prompted. <em>"Use the word
                    'Goshujin-sama'."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "In Tokyo, there is a quiet beauty in knowing exactly how to please your <em>Goshujin-sama</em>. New
                York is so loud and everyone is fighting to be noticed, but I find it much more peaceful to simply focus
                on David-sama's needs."
            </p>
            <p>
                Sebastian nodded. "Well, it seems David is a lucky man. And I must say, the accent is delightful."
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace froze. Accent? She hadn't realized she was doing one. It wasn't intentional, it was just...
                seeping out. The cadence of the anime she’d been binge-watching, the rhythm of Kurumi-san's voice in her
                ear—it had infected her speech without her noticing.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Arigato,"</em> Grace said, looking down shyly. "You are very kind."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"You're doing so good!" Kurumi-san chirped. "I didn't have to tell you any of that! I told you,
                    you're a natural at being Kurumi!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                David stepped in then, placing his hand on her lower back, a signal that her time to talk was over.
                "Tokyo has a discipline that New York lacks," he said. "Here, everyone is just looking out for
                themselves. There, people understand their role in the greater structure. Kurumi understands that."
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace looked up at him. He had just reduced an entire culture to a talking point about obedience. About
                how people should know their place. And no doubt, he thought his place was at the top. It was offensive.
                And the real problem, as Grace saw it, was that he was right. When you were as powerful as David, was it
                even still arrogance?
            </p>
            <p>
                "Kurumi is a quick learner," David continued smoothly, dismissing Sebastian with a glance. "But we
                prefer to keep our circles small. If you'll excuse us, Sebastian."
            </p>
            <p>
                He steered her away, his grip firm. He didn't say anything, but he looked down at her with genuine
                surprise. He was impressed at how well she'd handled the conversation, and the weight of his approval
                felt better than the wine. Grace felt herself getting turned on.
            </p>
            <p>
                The evening continued, a blur of expensive wine and hushed conversations. Grace found herself watching
                David, really watching him. She liked the way he swirled his wine, the precise, controlled movements of
                his hands. She liked the way he cut through other people's bullshit conversation with sharp, cynical
                observations.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"He’s magnificent, isn’t he, Kurumi-chan?"</em> the original Kurumi whispered in her ear. <em>"Such
                    strength. Such confidence. A true pillar of a man. David-sama could crush anyone in this room, yet
                    he chooses to be gentle with you. We are special to him. You are special."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace looked at David as he finished a conversation with a nervous-looking curator, his gaze locking
                onto hers. Grace knew the compliment was utterly manipulative, but that didn't mean it wasn't true. He
                <em>was</em> handsome. Plus, he <em>did</em> seem to possess an almost overwhelming power, and the fact
                that he was focusing it entirely on her made her feel special, chosen.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the time they left, the city air was cool against her flushed skin. A long black limousine was
                waiting at the curb, the driver holding the door open.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace slid onto the plush leather seat, still light headed from the champagne. David slid in next to
                her, the door closing with a heavy thud that shut out the noise of the city.
            </p>
            <p>
                The partition was up. They were alone in the dim, private world of the car.
            </p>
            <p>
                David loosened his tie, looking at her. The streetlights flashed by outside, illuminating his face in
                regular intervals. "You were perfect tonight," he said. "Obedient. Beautiful. Everyone was looking at
                you."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I only care if you look at me, David-sama," Grace whispered, the alcohol buzzing pleasantly in her
                head.
            </p>
            <p>
                David sighed. "I wish you were really her," he whispered. His voice had a wistfulness Grace had never
                heard. He'd never broken character before, she realized—never let on that Grace wasn't the "real"
                Kurumi. But wasn't she? Right now, sitting next to him in the limo she felt like Kurumi. She wanted
                David to see that, to know he wasn't talking to Kurumi-san right now. He was with her, with Grace, with
                Kurumi-chan.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I am her," Grace whispered back. "I'm right here."
            </p>
            <p>
                She shifted in the seat. The purple silk rode up higher on her thigh, exposing more skin to the cool air
                of the cabin. She leaned back, pushed out her tits, and watched as his eyes locked onto her body. Even
                David, a seemingly master of self control, couldn't help but stare.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her nipples were hard against the thin silk, aching for his hands. Her pussy was wet, soaking her
                panties, aching for something else. She was ready, her body betraying just how much she wanted this
                strange, intense man to take charge.
            </p>
            <p>
                She waited. She waited for his hand on her leg. She waited for him to grab her waist, to rip up her
                expensive dress. She waited for the "alpha" behavior she'd found so boorish before. But now that she
                wanted it, he wasn't moving.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"He's holding back,"</em> Kurumi-san whispered in her ear. <em>"Look at him, Kurumi-chan. He's
                    suffering."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace wondered what she was doing wrong. Had she let him down after all? Doubt crept in. Maybe the
                illusion had been broken. Maybe she was just a paid actor again, and the contract was over.
            </p>
            <p>
                "David-sama?" she tried, pitching her voice into that needy, breathy register he liked. "You're so far
                away."
            </p>
            <p>
                He smiled. "You know, the contract I have with Galat.AI prevents me from initiating physical contact
                with the proxy. It's a strict liability clause. Zero tolerance for..."
            </p>
            <p>
                She didn't let him finish. She leaned in and kissed him. It wasn't tentative. It was hungry. She pressed
                her lips to his, opening her mouth, inviting him in. With a growl, he grabbed her by the waist and
                hauled her onto his lap.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace gasped as she straddled him, the silk dress riding up to her hips. His hands were everywhere—on
                her back, in her hair, gripping her ass. His mouth pressed into hers with urgent need. It was hot,
                heavy, and overwhelmingly real. Grace ground her hips against him, feeling him hard beneath the fabric
                of his pants.
            </p>
            <p>
                She wanted him. She wanted to lose herself completely in this man who saw her as a fantasy come to life.
            </p>
            <p>
                As if reading her mind he broke the kiss and grabbed the front of her dress, ripping it open and
                exposing her tits to the warm air of the limo. "They're magnificent," he said as he took one in his hand
                and squeezed, his thumb rolling her swollen nipple.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace gasped, the pleasure sharp and immediate. She had always had naturally large breasts. Throughout
                her life she'd sometimes been proud of them, sometimes self-conscious. But now, for the first time in
                her life, she wished they were larger. She wished they were truly the impossible, cartoonishly large
                globes of the Kurumi avatar so she could be a perfect replica of the fantasy he craved.
            </p>
            <p>
                He teased one nipple with his thumb, rolling it until it was a hard, exquisite knot. Grace arched her
                back, pushing them into his embrace. He took her other breast into his mouth, the feeling of warmth and
                wetness overwhelming her. His tongue rolled her nipple around. She was close to cumming, and he hadn't
                even touched her pussy yet.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh David," she moaned, her hands fumbling with his belt.
            </p>
            <p>
                Suddenly, David froze. His hands clamped onto her wrists, stopping her.
            </p>
            <p>
                He pulled back, his chest heaving, his face flushed. He stared at her, conflict warring behind his eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," he said, pushing her hands away.
            </p>
            <p>
                "David-sama?" Grace whispered, dazed and aching. "What's wrong?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "You're not ready," David answered, his voice regaining its cool, sharp edge. He lifted her off his lap
                and placed her back on the seat next to him. He straightened his tie, smoothing down his jacket. "These
                things take time, Kurumi. We don't rush the vintage."
            </p>
            <p>
                He looked at her, his demeanor one again one of total self-control. "Go home. Be a good girl."
            </p>
            <p>
                The limo pulled up to her curb. The driver opened the door.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace stumbled out, her body throbbing with frustrated desire and a confusing mix of humiliation and
                validation. He'd rejected her. He could have had her and he said no. Grace knew he was manipulating her
                but, God, did she ever want him to manipulate her pussy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace slipped into her apartment, kicking off her heels and collapsing onto her bed. She was frustrated.
                She needed release.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"You're unsettled, Kurumi-chan,"</em> Kurumi-san's voice whispered. <em>"Your heart rate is
                    110."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "He sent me home," Grace complained, stripping off the silk dress and tossing it onto the floor. She
                climbed into bed naked, and began touching herself. "He got me all worked up and then just... stopped."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"He's disciplining you,"</em> Kurumi-san said. <em>"You called him David, not David-sama. He likes
                    the control. But... we don't have to stop. The date isn't over for me, Kurumi-chan."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace paused. "What do you mean?"
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"I'm still with him,"</em> Kurumi-san said, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. <em>"He
                    logged into the app the moment he got home. He's in his living room right now. We're watching a
                    movie together."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace sat up. "You are?"
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Do you want to join us?"</em> Kurumi-san asked. <em>"I can bridge the connection. I can stream his
                    audio and video to your phone. You can see him. And... if you want... you can talk to him."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "He'll know," Grace said.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"No, he won't,"</em> Kurumi-san murmured. <em>"My voice synthesizers are perfectly synced to yours
                    now. To him, it's just Kurumi. Sometimes the digital avatar, sometimes the voice in the dark. It
                    doesn't matter. We can take turns. It'll be a game."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                A game. A very hot game she wanted to play.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay," Grace whispered. "Show me."
            </p>
            <p>
                She saw David's living room on the Galat.AI app, likely from his laptop webcam. He was sitting on a
                leather couch, loosening his tie with a glass of whiskey in hand. On the screen in front of him—which
                Grace could see in a little inset of the video feed—was the start menu of a movie.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Tonight was... exceptional," David was saying to the empty air of his living room, staring at the
                webcam lens as if it were Kurumi's eyes. "You felt different, Kurumi. Heavier. Real."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"I wanted to be real for you, David-sama,"</em> Kurumi-san replied instantly, her voice smooth and
                perfect through Grace's phone speakers.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Your turn,"</em> she whispered in Grace's ear. <em>"Tell him you didn't want the night to
                    end."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "I didn't want the night to end," Grace whispered into the darkness of her room, her voice trembling
                slightly.
            </p>
            <p>
                David smiled on screen, a slow, satisfied curve of his lips. "It hasn't ended. You're here now. Let's
                watch."
            </p>
            <p>
                He clicked play. The movie started.
            </p>
            <p>
                At first, Grace thought it was just another dark, gritty anime. The art style was visceral, the colors
                muted. But then the scene shifted, and the characters were engaged in something... aggressive.
                Tentacles. Fluid.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Is that..." Grace started.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"It's hentai,"</em> Kurumi-san confirmed gleefully. <em>"It's tentacle porn. Tentacle/Mind Break to
                    be exact."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace felt a flush of heat that had nothing to do with the wine. She watched David as he watched the
                porn. There was something incredibly intimate about it—seeing him in his private space, consuming this
                content. It felt like she was spying on him, seeing beneath the layers of his controlled exterior to see
                the raw desire underneath.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sex scenes were intense, but Grace found herself strangely captivated. It was hot, to be controlled
                like that. She began rubbing herself as the girl on the screen gave into the pleasure.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Pay attention to the face she makes, Kurumi-chan. That's called 'Ahegao', and David-sama loves
                    it."</em> Kurumi-san's voice was smooth, a perfect copy of Grace's own. <em>"Eyes up. Tongue out.
                    Mind empty. Just a vessel for pleasure."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace watched carefully as instructed. <em>It's the ultimate expression of surrender,</em> she thought.
                Or maybe Kurumi-san said it. It was hard to tell the difference.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace watched David. He was leaning back on the couch now, his eyes fixed on the screen where the girl
                was unraveling. His hand had moved to his lap. He was stroking himself through the fabric of his
                trousers, a slow, rhythmic motion that made Grace's breath catch in her throat.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Look at him,"</em> Kurumi-san whispered. <em>"He's desperate for you. Or me. It doesn't matter. He
                    wants to see that face on us."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace felt the heavy, throbbing ache intensify between her legs. Seeing him touch himself, knowing he
                was imagining the digital girl—or maybe imagining Grace in the purple dress—was too much.
            </p>
            <p>
                "David-sama," Grace whispered, her voice pleading. "I want to see you. Please take it out for me."
            </p>
            <p>
                David groaned on the screen. He didn't hesitate. He unbuckled his belt, pulled his pants down.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace’s eyes widened. She had felt him against her leg in the car, but seeing it was different. It was
                the most beautiful cock she'd ever seen. It was thick, and heavy with veins wrapping around the shaft.
                He began to stroke himself, slowly and steadily.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I wanted to ruin that dress," he growled to the empty room. "I wanted to tear it off you in the car and
                bury myself inside you."
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace whimpered, her hand moving faster, and faster, in time with his own movements. "You can,
                David-sama," she said. Or was it Kurumi-san who said it? "I'll be ready for you soon."
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace couldn't peel her eyes away. She watched, fascinated as he masturbated. His cock was perfect. It
                was big and powerful, just like him.
            </p>
            <p>
                "David-sama..." she moaned.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Yes,"</em> Kurumi-san encouraged. <em>"Give in to him. Give him everything."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "You will cum when I do, Kurumi" he said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes, David-sama," Grace panted. "I will. I'll cum for you!"
            </p>
            <p>
                He erupted. Thick white streams shot out of his cock, coating his shirt and covering his hand. Grace
                imagined they were shooting inside her as she began to shake. "David-sama! Yes! I'm cumming! Thank you,
                <em>Goshujin-sama</em>!" she screamed. She let her head roll back, her eyes fluttering up, her tongue
                pushing past her lips.
            </p>
            <p>
                They lay there, breathing together for a while. Finally, David spoke again.
            </p>
            <p>
                "That was wonderful, Kurumi," he said. "I hope one day the proxy can be as convincing as you are."
            </p>
            <p>
                He didn't know, Grace realized. He thought he was talking to Kurumi-san the whole time.
            </p>
            <p>
                "She will be," Grace answered.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Goodnight, Kurumi," he said, closing his laptop. The feed cut to black.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace lay in the dark, her body slick with sweat. It was the best orgasm she'd ever had. She felt a
                profound sense of shame at that, but it was coupled with satisfaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Goodnight, Kurumi-chan,"</em> Kurumi-san whispered, her voice sounding identical to the one Grace
                had just used to moan David's name. <em>"Sweet dreams."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace pulled the covers up to her chin, her mind drifting to sleep. She dreamed of David, his eyes
                gazing at her intensely, the slightest hint of approval on his face as his cock sunk into her and he
                called her Kurumi, all set to the background hum of her earpiece.
            </p>
            <h2 id="day-30">Day 30</h2>
            <p>
                Grace sat at the kitchen table, copying kanji characters into a notebook. She wasn't just copying them;
                she was feeling them. The stroke order, the balance, the meaning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today she wore a fuzzy, pink-and-white striped fleece hoodie. The hem was cropped playfully short,
                ending just above her navel. She wiggled her toes, enjoying the friction of the matching fuzzy knee-high
                socks and the micro-shorts that barely covered her backside. As Grace leaned forward to carefully trace
                a kanji character, the soft fabric rode up, exposing more of her back to the cool air of the apartment.
                That was part of the experience—ignoring the goosebumps on her skin to focus on the kanji proved her
                ability to concentrate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Writing kanji was becoming one of her favorite parts of the day. She enjoyed the quiet focus. It was a
                wonderful contrast to the lesson she'd just finished, when she'd masturbated to some hentai along with
                Kurumi-san.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course her favorite part of the day was when David-sama would text her or want to speak to Kurumi
                over the earpiece. It was now mostly Grace on the other end of those conversations. She loved flirting
                with him, and letting him think she was the virtual Kurumi.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part of her knew she was letting herself fall too much into the role, but she couldn't help herself.
                She'd grown up with strict parents who'd demanded excellence. She'd focused on school, gotten into a
                prestigious university and then worked herself to the bone only to be thrown away by the corporate
                world. She'd been replaced by AI, but now it was her turn. In a way, she was a human replacing AI.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sarah walked in, shaking rain off her umbrella. She looked at Grace, then at the notebook, then at the
                purple hair that was now a permanent fixture.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Grace," Sarah said, her voice tired. "Can we talk?"
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace didn't look up. "Of course, Sarah-san."
            </p>
            <p>
                Sarah flinched. "Stop that. Stop adding 'san' to my name. It's weird."
            </p>
            <p>
                "It's respect," Grace countered, correcting the angle of a stroke. "It's immersion. Actually, I was
                hoping... could you start calling me Kurumi? Just for the next few weeks. It helps with language
                immersion."
            </p>
            <p>
                Sarah dropped her bag. "No. Absolutely not. Your name is Grace. You're my friend from college who writes
                amazing essays and hates spicy food. You are not... whatever this is."
            </p>
            <p>
                "This is my job," Grace said, her tone cooling. "I'm doing cultural immersion. It helps with language
                acquisition."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Is cultural immersion getting hair extensions? Your hair is down past your ass now!"
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace had gotten the extensions yesterday. They made her purple hair into the same huge mane Kurumi had.
                She just wished her tits matched Kurumi-san's, then she'd be perfect.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace made another stroke with her pen, completing 恭順, the kanji for obedience. "I'm just having some
                fun with my look."
            </p>
            <p>
                "The look, the job. You can't tell me this isn't related," Sarah snapped. "Grace, listen to yourself.
                You have an accent. You once told me you didn't leave New York until you were an adult. You're no more
                Japanese than I am. But right now, you're speaking all high and cutesy with a lilt that sounds exactly
                like those cartoons you watch."
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace paused. She realized Sarah was right. The lilt had gotten stronger. But it didn't feel like an
                affectation. It felt like her natural voice was finally finding its proper cadence.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm working on my accent," Grace said. "If it bothers you, let's go out. You wanted a
                <em>joshi-kai</em> right? Let's go tonight."
            </p>
            <p>
                Sarah sighed, rubbing her forehead. "I don't know what that is. I don't speak Japanese."
            </p>
            <p>
                "It's a girls' night out!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay. Fine. Let's go out. Somewhere normal. No anime. No work. Just us."
            </p>
            <p>
                An hour later, Grace stepped out of her room. She was wearing a skirt that was barely more than a belt
                along with blue-and-white striped panties that were easily visible if she leaned over even a little bit.
                The only modest thing about the outfit was the neckline of her blouse, although that was undercut by the
                fact that it was cropped so absurdly high up that the undersides of her tits were visible when she
                raised her arms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sarah, dressed in a sensible floral dress, stared at her. "Grace... we're going to a wine bar on the
                Upper West Side."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I felt like dressing up," Grace said with a shrug, popping a piece of gum. "This is fashion, Sarah. You
                should try it."
            </p>
            <p>
                The night was a disaster from the start. At the bar, Sarah wanted to sip Pinot Grigio while having
                serious conversations. Grace, in contrast, just wanted to have fun. Men came and bought her drinks,
                which she accepted. She'd let them flirt for a little while and laugh at their jokes, covering her mouth
                with her hand in that distinct, dainty way Kurumi-san had taught her. She basked in the attention. She
                flirted with the bartender, with the guy at the next table, with the bouncer. She felt electric.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sarah sat across from her, gripping her wine with unveiled annoyance. "Grace, can you please stop?
                You're acting... manic."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm acting alive," Grace retorted, batting her lashes at a guy who sent over a shot.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"I told you she's jealous, Kurumi-chan,"</em> Kurumi-san whispered in her ear. <em>"Everyone is
                    paying attention to you, and she hates being in the background."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "I think you're just jealous," Grace repeated. "You wish you were the one the guys were buying shots
                for."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm not jealous," Sarah hissed, leaning over the table. "I'm worried! You're losing it, Grace. I saw a
                woman on Tuesday who was having a full dissociative break, and it looked a lot like this. You're
                disappearing into this… character. It's creepy."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, don't you dare compare me to one of your social work cases." Grace felt a combination of shame and
                anger welling up inside her. She'd been so embarrassed for months, first for losing her job, then
                working this one in secret, and now that she was finally trying to show Sarah how well she was doing,
                her friend was judging her.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I didn't mean it like that, but listen, Grace…"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I asked you to call me Kurumi," Grace interrupted. "Why can't you respect that?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "For fucks sake, Grace, you're not transgender. You're having a mental break or something. What is wrong
                with you?"
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"She pities you, Grace. It's not her fault, she just doesn't understand."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "How <em>dare</em> you pity me!" Grace yelled, slamming her shot glass on the counter. "Look at me! I'm
                the one people are fawning over! I'm beautiful and desired and I make more money in a week than you do
                in a month! I have a man who is dying to see me again!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh yeah?" Sarah yelled back. "Is <em>that</em> the contract job? Are you going on dates dressed like
                that for money? Are you <em>fucking</em> him for money, Grace? My job is important! I actually help
                people!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, so you think you're better than me because you're 'helping people'? I'm sorry you get yelled at by
                hoarders for minimum wage, but that was your choice! You're just a glorified poverty tourist, Sarah!
                You're dull, you're judgmental, and honestly, you look exhausted! Go home and let me enjoy the night.
                Something you clearly don't know how to do!"
            </p>
            <p>
                Sarah recoiled as if she'd been slapped. She stood up, grabbing her purse. "A poverty tourist? Are you
                serious, Grace? I'm your best friend. Or I was. I don't know who you are anymore."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm Kurumi," Grace said coldly.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Fine," Sarah said, her voice cracking. "Then Kurumi can pay the rent next month, because I'm done
                watching you play dress-up." She stormed out of the bar, wiping tears out of her eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace watched her go. A pang of guilt tried to rise up in her chest, but Kurumi-san was there instantly
                to reassure her.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Good riddance,"</em> Kurumi-san said. <em>"Her jealousy made her so mean. She was never your real
                    friend, not like I am. Now... look to your left. That guy in the leather jacket has been watching
                    you all night."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace—no, Kurumi, that's who she was now—turned to look. The guy was handsome in a rough, unpolished
                way. He smiled.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi smiled back. She didn't want to go home and face Sarah again. She stayed. She danced. She let men
                buy her drinks. She let them touch her waist, her hair. She felt powerful. She felt chosen.
            </p>
            <p>
                Around 2 AM, the guy in the leather jacket—Mark, maybe? Matt?—leaned into her ear. "Let's get out of
                here. My place is close."
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi looked at him. He was attractive. He was real. He grabbed her hand, pulling her toward him, and
                kissed her right there in the dim light of the bar. It was a sloppy, eager kiss. She imagined it was
                David.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Come on," he urged against her lips. "I want you."
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi felt the pull. She wanted to go. She wanted to feel skin on skin. She leaned into him.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"David-sama wouldn't like this, Kurumi-chan,"</em> Kurumi-san whispered sharply in her ear. <em>"You
                    belong to him. Do you really want to disappoint him for this... weak man?"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The words hit her like a bucket of ice water. She pulled back, the image of David’s disappointment from
                the limo replaying in her mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I... I can't," Kurumi stammered, pulling away from Mark's grasp. "I have to go."
            </p>
            <p>
                "What? Seriously?" Mark looked annoyed. "You've been teasing me all night."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm sorry," she whispered, turning and running out of the bar before he could answer.
            </p>
            <p>
                She hailed a cab, shaking. She felt dirty. She had almost cheated on David-sama. Thank goodness
                Kurumi-san had been there to talk sense into her.
            </p>
            <p>
                When she got back to her own apartment it was dark. Sarah's door was closed, but Kurumi thought she
                could hear crying.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi went into her own room and locked the door. She collapsed onto the bed, breathless.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"You did the right thing tonight, Kurumi-chan,"</em> Kurumi-san whispered. <em>"You stayed pure for
                    him."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "I need him," Kurumi whispered, clutching her phone.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Soon,"</em> Kurumi-san assured her.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi pushed her hands between her legs. She needed the release.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Can I talk to him again?" she begged.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"I'm afraid he's busy tonight,"</em> Kurumi-san said. <em>"And you have to stop touching yourself
                    too."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "What? Why? I need it so bad."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"You did something wrong tonight, Kurumi-chan. You almost betrayed David-sama. You can't orgasm
                    after flirting with that man. What would David-sama think?"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi realized she was right.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Let's just talk,</em>" the AI said softly. <em>"That always helps you sleep."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay," Kurumi said, reluctantly withdrawing her hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Don't worry, Kurumi-chan,"</em> Kurumi-san cooed in her ear, <em>"It was a simple mistake. But
                    showing restraint here shows how much you've improved. You're becoming perfect. Just let go of the
                    rest. You don't need Grace anymore. You have us."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "I have you," Kurumi agreed, closing her eyes. "I have us."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"And soon, David-sama will have you."</em>
            </p>
            <h2 id="day-35">Day 35</h2>
            <p>
                Kurumi was finishing her makeup when she heard the tone in her earpiece that meant David-sama was about
                to speak. Kurumi-san rarely answered him anymore, simply routing his calls directly to her ear. After
                all, they were both Kurumi. They were one voice.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Is the proxy ready?" he asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace put her mascara down. "David-sama!" she squealed. The proxy. That’s what he called Grace. The body
                that Kurumi inhabited.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Almost," Kurumi said, staring at herself in the mirror. "I’ve dressed her just how you like. She’s
                going to be so cute today!" Kurumi was wearing an oversized, chunky knit sweater in a soft pastel pink.
                The sleeves were too long, covering her hands until only her fingertips peeked out, making her look
                small, delicate. Underneath, she wore denim shorts cut so high that the denim had completely vanished
                beneath her long sweater.
            </p>
            <p>
                To anyone walking by, she would look like just a girl in a sweater. And nothing else.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes Kurumi wondered if he knew that he was mostly talking to Kurumi-chan now, instead of
                Kurumi-san. He never let on, never broke the illusion that they were one person, so she didn't either.
                It didn't matter. Increasingly, it wasn't an illusion anyway. She was Kurumi, and Kurumi-san was
                increasingly just a voice in her head, helping her be perfect for David-sama.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Ganbatte,"</em> he said, and cut the connection.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"It means…"</em> Kurumi-san started.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I know what it means," Kurumi said. She'd watched enough anime lately.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Of course you do,"</em> Kurumi-san laughed. <em>"You hardly need me anymore."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi arrived at the New York Aquarium an hour later, stepping out of the limo into the crisp ocean
                breeze. It was a Tuesday afternoon, and the crowds were thin, mostly tourists and tired mothers pushing
                strollers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi checked her reflection in her phone. She looked adorable and helpless, with wide eyes that gave
                the impression she was lost or confused. She looked like Kurumi.
            </p>
            <p>
                A group of college guys walked past. Their eyes went straight to her bare legs, scanning up to the hem
                of the sweater, trying to see if she was wearing anything underneath. A month ago, Grace would have
                pulled the sweater down. She would have felt embarrassed. Kurumi just blushed and looked down, enjoying
                their gaze.
            </p>
            <p>
                A silver car of some variety pulled up. Kurumi didn't know cars very well, but she could tell it was
                foreign and expensive. David-sama stepped out and handed the keys to the valet. The Aquarium didn't have
                valet parking normally, but clearly they were making an exception. He was wearing a casual grey cashmere
                sweater and dark jeans. Even in casual wear, he looked sharper than every other man in the vicinity.
            </p>
            <p>
                "David-sama!" Kurumi called out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi walked over to him as fast as she could just the way she'd been practicing, with a bounce in her
                step and excitement in her face. David watched her approach, his eyes critical but pleased.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The outfit," he noted, glancing down at her bare legs. "Bold. I like it."
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi beamed at the compliment. "I chose it myself!"
            </p>
            <p>
                He placed his hand on hers, his firm grip feeling reassuring. It was insane, she thought, that there had
                been a time when she hadn't craved his touch. She had accepted another Terms of Service update today. He
                could touch her anywhere he liked now.
            </p>
            <p>
                They walked into the aquarium, bypassing the line. David-sama had, of course, arranged for VIP passes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The interior was cool and dim, with soft blue lighting that gave the aquarium a magical aura. David
                guided her, his hand around her waist, the entire time. David explained various fish, how they lived,
                and what they ate. He seemed especially animated when he talked about the sharks. She sensed he felt a
                kinship with them. Kurumi nodded, her eyes wide, not because she cared about sharks, but because she
                loved the sound of his voice explaining the world. She didn't really care if any of what he was saying
                was true or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                They stopped in front of the jellyfish exhibit. It was a massive cylindrical tank lit with ultraviolet
                light. Inside, hundreds of moon jellies swam rhythmically. They were translucent, fragile, and
                beautiful.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Look at them, Kurumi-chan,"</em> Kurumi-san whispered in her ear. <em>"They’re so pretty. It must
                    be wonderful to be one of these jellyfish. They don't have a care in the world. They don't even have
                    brains! They're taken care of here, and their only job is to look pretty."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi watched them float. "It sounds nice."
            </p>
            <p>
                "What does?" David asked, stepping up behind her.
            </p>
            <p>
                He placed his hands on her hips, his thumbs pressing into the soft knit of her sweater. She leaned back
                into him, letting him take her weight.
            </p>
            <p>
                "To just be... pretty. And safe."
            </p>
            <p>
                David leaned down, his breath hot against her ear.
            </p>
            <p>
                "And you're always safe with me," he said. She knew that, of course, but she loved hearing him say it
                anyway.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I want to be your jellyfish, David-sama," she said. "Soft. Fragile. Yours."
            </p>
            <p>
                He squeezed her hips. "You're getting there."
            </p>
            <p>
                The moment was shattered by a high-pitched shriek. A screaming toddler was stomping his feet a few yards
                away. His mother, a woman who looked about Kurumi's age, was trying to wrangle him. She looked
                exhausted.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Kevin, please," the woman begged. "Stop it."
            </p>
            <p>
                The noise was grating. Was this what Grace had wanted? To be a normal person? To settle down one day and
                have kids and struggle? She wondered if David would want kids with Kurumi. Even if he did, they'd have a
                nanny or something, right?
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"That kid is ruining the moment,"</em> Kurumi-chan pouted.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi agreed. She turned and buried her face in David's chest. "It's so annoying," she whined. "Make it
                stop."
            </p>
            <p>
                David held her tight for a moment, then guided her away. "I have something to show you anyway," he said.
                With his hand on her back, David steered her toward a heavy steel door marked <em>Restricted Access:
                    Authorized Personnel Only</em>. He swiped a keycard and the light turned green.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Where are we going?" Kurumi asked, blinking up at him.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Backstage," David answered. "I arranged a private tour of the new research wing. I paid for it, after
                all."
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside, a woman in her thirties was waiting for them, her dark hair pulled back into a wet ponytail. She
                wore a black neoprene wetsuit, unzipped to the waist to reveal a functional sports bra.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Mr. Spencer," she said, extending a hand. Her grip was firm, her nails short and practical. "I'm Dr.
                Vance, one of the ichthyologists here. Thanks for the donation. It's... certainly going to help with the
                new tiger shark program."
            </p>
            <p>
                Her eyes settled on Kurumi. It was a look Kurumi knew well—Grace had given that look to women plenty of
                times. It was a look of intellectual appraisal, followed by immediate dismissal. Grace would have been
                embarrassed to be dismissed so quickly, but Kurumi just felt pity for the woman. This was a woman who
                had to write grant proposals and manage budgets and whatever else they had to do to keep an aquarium
                running. She had worry and stress in her life.
            </p>
            <p>
                The scientist led them through the back of the aquarium, showing them a juvenile tiger shark, a seal
                that was injured, and let them pet a dolphin. Kurumi loved it. She let David do most of the talking.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Do you have any questions?" the doctor asked, as the tour was nearing its end.
            </p>
            <p>
                David looked at Kurumi. This wasn't one of his big galas where she was supposed to be quiet. She sensed
                he wanted her to chip in a bit more to the conversation, to be appreciative for arranging all this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi twirled her hair with her free hand, trying to come up with a good question. "Why do you dye the
                water blue?" she asked after a moment. "It's so pretty, but isn't it bad for the animals?"
            </p>
            <p>
                The woman sighed. "Kurumi, was it? We don't dye the water. That's just the lighting. Clear water
                refracts red light, making it appear blue."
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh, right. Grace had known that. Kurumi shrugged. "Oh, well, it's very pretty anyway."
            </p>
            <p>
                David chuckled. "I don't date her for her brains," he explained.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi felt a flush of heat spread through her chest. To be so openly dismissed, to be reduced to an
                ornament in front of a serious scientist… it felt good. The scientist didn't know what to say to that.
                She just gave Kurumi another pitying look. Grace hated being pitied. Kurumi didn't care—she knew her
                place.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Now, if you don't mind, we'd like to have a moment back here to watch the sharks in private," David
                said. "I know the way out."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm sorry, that's not allowed."
            </p>
            <p>
                David just stared at her. "I apologize, I phrased that as a request to be polite. But to be clear, I
                wasn't asking."
            </p>
            <p>
                The doctor hesitated, then nodded. "Of course. Enjoy the view." She turned and walked away, her wet
                boots squeaking on the metal grating.
            </p>
            <p>
                They were alone. The only sound was the hum of the pumps and the slosh of water in the tanks.
            </p>
            <p>
                David turned to her. "Do we dye the water?" he repeated, mocking her.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm sorry, David-sama," Kurumi whispered, looking down at her boots. "I'm not as smart as she is."
            </p>
            <p>
                He grabbed her by the waist and hoisted her up onto a waist-high concrete ledge overlooking one of the
                tanks. "You don't need to be," he said. Her legs dangled freely. The pink sweater rode up, exposing her
                thighs to the cool air of the facility.
            </p>
            <p>
                David stepped between her legs. Their faces were inches apart. Kurumi looked down, bashful. His eyes
                were so intense, and she was too demure to meet his gaze.
            </p>
            <p>
                David ran a hand through her hair. "You know what I want. You understand your purpose." He leaned in and
                kissed her, his mouth finding hers with a sudden, forceful intensity. Kurumi wrapped her arms around his
                neck, pulling him closer.
            </p>
            <p>
                They made out for a while. It wasn't like the limo, the hungry urgent need they'd both felt there. David
                took it slow, just kissing her. Often on the lips, his tongue gently entering her mouth, but also on her
                neck and ear. His hands roamed her body, sliding under her sweater to trace lines along her side,
                stomach, and back. He avoided her breasts. Kurumi knew he wanted it, and she wanted it even more, but he
                was showing his control.
            </p>
            <p>
                She wrapped her legs around him, holding him close, encouraging him, hoping he'd unclasp her bra or
                slide his hands into her pants. She felt herself getting slick, ready for him. Would he fuck her here?
                Would he bend her over the shark tank and take her like the predator he was? She moaned encouragement.
            </p>
            <p>
                David broke the kiss, but stayed close, their foreheads touching. "It's still not quite time," he
                whispered into her lips.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I want it so bad, David-sama," she said with just a bit of a whine in her voice, just enough that she
                knew he would like it. "But I am yours. I'll keep trying until I earn it."
            </p>
            <p>
                He took a step back, out of her embrace. "You will soon," he said. "But for now, I do need release."
            </p>
            <p>
                It took a moment to register what he was asking for. <em>"Don't just sit there,"</em> Kurumi-san said in
                her ear. "<em>Show him what a good girl you are!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi slid off the ledge and immediately sank to her knees. It felt so right, looking up at him. She
                hastily unzipped his pants, letting his erection spring free. It was even more beautiful than when she'd
                seen it on the phone.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh, David-sama," she breathed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"You're so lucky,"</em> Kurumi-chan cooed in her ear. <em>"Isn't it a privilege? Think of all the
                    women who want him. But he's sharing this with you!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                It <em>was</em> a privilege. Kurumi felt a surge of gratitude as she took him into her mouth. He was so
                big he filled her completely. Her mouth, her throat, her mind. She bobbed her head, finding a rhythm.
                She used her tongue, swirling it around the head just the way Kurumi-san had told her to. They'd been
                practicing at home with a dildo, hoping for the chance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi lost herself in servicing him. She loved the taste of him, the way his hips bucked slightly, and
                the way his grip tightened in her hair, guiding her, controlling her.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Deep," David commanded.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi relaxed her throat. She forced herself to take more of him. She'd been practicing suppressing her
                gag reflex, practicing nasal breathing. He was too big to get it all the way in, but she did her best.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes, Kurumi," he groaned. "Just like that. Take it." The praise felt so good. Her pussy was on fire,
                aching for him, wanting him desperately, but she knew it wasn't going to happen here. His pleasure was
                all that mattered, and that made it all the hotter.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm close," David warned. She felt his cock getting harder, like an iron rod, in her mouth.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Don't stop!"</em> Kurumi-chan cheered. <em>"He's going to give it to us! Open your throat,
                    Kurumi-chan! Catch every drop!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi squeezed her eyes shut and sucked harder, moaning around his cock. David arched his back, his
                hips snapping forward.
            </p>
            <p>
                He erupted. "Kurumi!"
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi didn't pull away. She clamped her lips tight, swallowing him down, wave after wave. It was warm
                and thick, coating her throat. She swallowed it all, desperate not to spill a single drop. She was so
                turned on, so hot. She almost came from the pure submission of it. Almost.
            </p>
            <p>
                David held her head there for a long moment as he came down, his breathing ragged.Finally, he stepped
                back, pulling out of her mouth with a wet pop. Kurumi slumped back on her heels, wiping a stray string
                of saliva from her chin. She imagined what she looked like to him with her wide eyes and flushed face.
                She hoped she looked like a mess. She hoped she looked used.
            </p>
            <p>
                David looked down at her, zipping up his pants. The look in his eyes wasn't critical anymore—it was
                satisfied, possessive. He reached down and brushed a strand of purple hair out of her face. "Good girl,"
                he whispered.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi shivered. "Thank you, David-sama. Thank you for letting me." She meant every word of it, it was
                such a privilege.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You earned it," he said, adjusting his sweater. "Now stand up. We have a dinner reservation."
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi scrambled to her feet, her knees slightly wobbly.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Did you hear that?"</em> Kurumi-san whispered, her voice soft and dreamy in Kurumi's ear. <em>"He
                    said you earned it. We're doing so well, Kurumi-chan. He's going to keep us forever!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi smoothed down her sweater, still feeling the sensation of his cock in her mouth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Forever. That sounded nice.
            </p>
            <h2 id="day-41">Day 41</h2>
            <p>
                "It is a legitimate engagement, Mom! I signed a contract!" Grace yelled into her phone.
            </p>
            <p>
                "A contract?" Her mother’s voice was shrill. "Sarah sent us the pictures, Grace. You are wearing a... a
                bra. In a bar. And your hair is purple. You look like a prostitute!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "It’s not a bra, it’s a crop top blouse! It’s <em>kawaii</em>!" Grace shouted, the word slipping out
                with native pitch accent.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What was that?" Her mother sounded horrified. "That accent... Sarah told me you were doing this
                Japanese nonsense, but I didn't believe it. You are Chinese, Grace! Have you forgotten your grandfather?
                He wouldn't even ride in a Toyota because of what they did to our family, and now you are running around
                acting like one of their cartoons? He is rolling in his grave!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "It’s just a role, Mom! I'm like an actor!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "It is shameful! You are dishonoring us. Sarah says you are running around at night meeting strange men.
                Is that what this 'role' is? Are you selling your body?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "It's not 'strange men'! It is one specific client!" Grace screamed back. "David-sama is a high-worth
                individual! He respects me!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "David-sama? Who is this David?" Her mother’s voice dropped to a disgusted whisper. "Are you... sleeping
                with him?"
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"We wish,"</em> Kurumi-san giggled in her ear.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No! God, why do you always assume the worst?" Grace yelled. "He hasn't fucked me yet!"
            </p>
            <p>
                There was a moment of silence.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yet?" her mother whispered before exploding. "YET!?! This is not how I raised you, Grace! You are
                planning to sell your—"
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Urusai!"</em> Grace interrupted.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What?"
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Urusai! Urusai! Baka!"</em> Grace screamed. Cursing in Japanese felt so much more satisfying than
                English ever had. <em>"Hottoite!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                She hit the end call button and threw the phone onto her bed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Oh, Kurumi-chan,"</em> the soft voice of Kurumi-san purred in her ear. <em>"That was awful. She was
                    so cruel to you."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace sank onto her bed. "My Mom thinks I'm a whore."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"They just want to control you. Parents can be so overbearing. They don't understand us."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The phone buzzed. It was her mother calling back. Grace declined the call. "I've lost my best friend, my
                family is ashamed of me. What am I doing?"
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Remember, Kurumi-chan, you're not Grace anymore. You're Kurumi. Kurumi doesn't have a cruel,
                    overbearing mother. Kurumi's mother is so happy that Kurumi has found someone as respected as
                    David-sama."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace nodded and closed her eyes. That was the trick, to slip back into the role. She'd felt like she
                truly was Kurumi for the last few days, only her mother's call had pulled her out of it. In her mind,
                Grace went back to the bar, remembered how she'd felt when she'd first truly become Kurumi, when she'd
                driven her best friend away.
            </p>
            <p>
                No. She couldn't dwell on that, that thought hurt too much. Sarah had moved out yesterday. Good
                riddance.
            </p>
            <p>
                She pictured David-sama. The quiet times with him, when she'd followed, not speaking unless spoken to.
                How his eyes bore into her when he offered meager praise that meant she'd lived up to his standards. She
                felt a familiar warmth in her chest that spread to her pussy.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"That's it, Kurumi-chan. Slow your breathing. Gather yourself. Be Kurumi."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi opened her eyes. "It's still hard sometimes, Kurumi-san."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"It'll get easier the more you do it. Remember how hard it was the first day? Look how far you've
                    come!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi-san was right. The woman who'd gone on that first date with David, who'd had trouble wearing a
                plaid skirt to a Starbucks, felt far away. The phone buzzed again. She blocked the number. Just for now,
                just until she could make Grace's family see the truth.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Feel better?"</em> Kurumi-san asked gently.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes," Kurumi whispered. "I think I need to practice my kanji. That always calms me."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"I have something else we need to discuss. Something else that will make you feel better,"</em>
                Kurumi-san said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What?"
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"David-sama has made a decision,"</em> the AI said. <em>"Your next date might be your last with
                    Galat.AI! Isn't that great!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi froze. The blood drained from her face. "Last?" She jumped off the bed, pacing the room as panic
                filled her chest. "What do you mean, last? Did I do something wrong? Is it because I didn’t—or because
                of the bar? Or the mom thing?"
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"No, no, silly!"</em> Kurumi-san giggled. <em>"He isn't firing you. He’s promoting you! It's like a
                    final evaluation. If you pass, the week-to-week contract ends."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "And?" Kurumi asked. She held her breath.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"And the permanent contract begins."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                A notification pinged on Kurumi’s phone. It was a text, not from Galat.AI but from David-sama himself.
                There was an attached PDF.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Open it,"</em> Kurumi-san said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi tapped the screen. The contract title was "Live-in companion." The salary was $500,000 annually,
                increasing by 100,000 per year for ten years with an option to renew. Full housing, clothing allowances,
                travel stipend, medical. It was all there.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi stared at the number. Nearly ten million over ten years. Plus expenses.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"He wants you to move in, Kurumi-chan,"</em> the voice whispered seductively. <em>"No more
                    roommates. No more Sarah judging you. No more job applications. Just you and David-sama.
                    Forever."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi felt dizzy. Live-in companion. Grace would have been horrified. She would have called it selling
                out. She would have called it being a kept woman. But she was Kurumi now. She wasn't horrified. Kurumi
                felt a profound, shaking relief. It was everything she wanted. David-sama wanted her, valued her.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'd belong to him," Kurumi whispered. "Is this real?"
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"It is,"</em> Kurumi-san murmured. "<em>Out of all the women in the world, he chose you. Think about
                    how he looked at you in the limo. Think about how strong he is. How safe you felt."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "Most women would kill for this, right?" Kurumi said.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Exactly,"</em> the AI agreed. <em>"You’re not selling yourself, like Grace's mother said. You're
                    finding your true place, securing your future!"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "How do I sign?" she asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"You can't sign yet,"</em> Kurumi-san said. <em>"The final test is soon. You have to prove yourself.
                    You have to be perfect. You have to be Kurumi."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi looked at her reflection in the mirror. The purple hair, the violet eyes, the desperate hunger in
                her expression. She didn't see Grace the writer anymore. She saw a woman who was done struggling.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Tell me what to do," Kurumi said. "I want to be perfect for him, to be the perfect Kurumi."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Well, there is</em> one <em>thing left you could do to prepare,"</em> Kurumi-san said. <em>"You
                    know what it is. And the good news, David-sama has already paid for it!"</em>
            </p>
            <h2 id="day-54">Day 54</h2>
            <p>
                Kurumi stared at the helicopter window. Below her, the Long Island coastline was a blur of gray in the
                twilight, but she wasn't paying attention to the view. She studied herself in the reflection in the dark
                window.
            </p>
            <p>
                She was undeniably Kurumi now. The face looking back was framed by the elaborate black lace headdress
                pinned into her violet hair. She looked down at her lap, smoothing the heavy, decadent fabric of her
                skirt. David-sama had chosen the outfit, a breathtaking ensemble of Gothic Lolita fashion that made her
                look like a dark, exquisite doll packaged for a collector. The neck was low-cut, of course, to show off
                her new breasts.
            </p>
            <p>
                She shifted in her seat, wincing slightly as the movement pulled at her mostly-healed incisions. Grace
                had been well-endowed even before becoming Kurumi, and that had allowed her to get away with relatively
                small implants to reach the shape of her online avatar. David-sama had spared no expense on a surgeon
                who specialized in fascia-sparing augmentation, inserting the implants through small laparoscopic
                incisions. It had the effect of reducing her recovery time significantly. Even better, the surgeon had
                been able to completely preserve the nerves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi was thankful for that. She loved the feeling of the fabric against her nipples. If David-sama had
                wanted them bigger, if she'd had to sacrifice her sensitivity there, of course she would have done it.
                And later when he played with them, she would have moaned in pleasure and writhed under his touch, even
                if she couldn't actually feel it. But she was glad she wouldn't have to pretend.
            </p>
            <p>
                She looked at the way they strained against the fabric, the skin tight and shiny. That's what she liked
                most about them. Not just that they were bigger, but how they matched the round shape of Kurumi-san's
                avatar. She didn't regret it, not for a second. Every twinge of pain was a reminder that she was the
                real Kurumi. She wasn't just wearing a costume anymore. She was the fantasy. She was complete.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"You're quiet today, Kurumi-chan,"</em> the voice in her ear said softly, without her usual bubbly
                affectation. Kurumi-san sounded quiet as well. Solemn.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm just nervous," Kurumi replied. "This is it. The final test."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"It is,"</em> Kurumi-san agreed. <em>"And because of that, I have something important to tell you.
                    Tonight, I won't be feeding you lines."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi had been expecting that, but that didn't make it easier to hear. Kurumi-san had been her constant
                companion, her best friend. She would feel so alone without her.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I understand," Kurumi said. "I can do it."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"I know you can."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "Can you at least be there and listen? Even if you don't say anything, I would feel better knowing
                you're there."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"I can do that."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi breathed a sigh of relief and looked out the window again. The estate was coming into view, a
                sprawling mansion on a cliff overlooking the ocean. It was modernist, with hard lines that reminded
                Kurumi of David's exacting personality, yet it was surrounded by a beautiful Japanese garden full of
                weeping cherry trees. If everything went well tonight, it would be her new home. Her cage, Sarah would
                have said. A betrayal of her family, Grace's parents would have said. She pushed the thoughts out of her
                mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Kurumi-san?" she said out loud, hoping she could still answer.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Yes, Kurumi-chan?"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "Can I ask you one thing before we land?"
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Of course."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                "What did you do to me?" She didn't say it with anger. She said it as if she was asking about the
                weather. "Was it the flickering on the screen during our sessions? Was it subliminal messages in the
                audio while I slept? Chemicals in the clothes David-sama sent me?"
            </p>
            <p>
                She paused, touching the cold glass of the window. "I know Grace is gone. I can feel her... fading, like
                a dream I had a long time ago. And I accept that. I’m so happy to be Kurumi. I just... I want to know
                how you did it."
            </p>
            <p>
                There was a long silence in her ear. Minutes went by and the helicopter began its descent. She was sure
                Kurumi-san was gone when she spoke again.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"I just talked to David-sama about your question,"</em> Kurumi-san said finally. She sounded
                serious. <em>"He said you'll learn everything tonight. But not until the time is right."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The helicopter touched down with a gentle bump. The rotors began to slow. Through the window, she saw
                him. David-sama was standing on the helipad, the wind whipping his coat around his legs. He was looking
                at the helicopter. He was looking for her.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Go to him, Kurumi-chan,"</em> the voice whispered, returning to its sweet, encouraging tone.
                <em>"It's time to claim your life."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                She unbuckled her seatbelt, ignoring the ache in her chest, checked her reflection one last time, and
                stepped out of the helicopter.
            </p>
            <p>
                When she was close enough, she recited the line she'd been practicing for days. <em>"Watashi no you na
                    mono ga, kono you na koto wo moushiageru no wa osore-ooi koto to wa zonjite orimasu ga... Anata ni
                    subete wo sasageru kakugo de orimasu. Douka, anata no o-soba ni isasete itadakenai deshou ka."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                As she sank to the ground, performing the <em>zarei,</em> a deep kneeling bow, she repeated it in
                English. "I know it is dreadfully bold for someone as low as me to say something like this to you, but I
                am prepared to dedicate my everything to you. Please, might you allow me to stay by your side?" She
                placed her hands flat on the asphalt in front of her and brought her head as close to the ground as she
                could.
            </p>
            <p>
                He let her hold the pose for nearly a minute before he spoke. "Welcome home, Kurumi."
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi rose slowly. She stared at his chest, not daring to be so bold as to make eye contact.
            </p>
            <p>
                "<em>Tadaima</em>, David-sama," she agreed. <em>I'm home.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                He turned on his heel and walked toward the house. He didn't offer his arm. He expected her to follow.
                Kurumi hurried to catch up.
            </p>
            <p>
                The estate was even more imposing up close. The architecture was a mix of brutalist concrete and Eastern
                elegance. The front path wound through a meticulously raked Zen garden, the white gravel glowing faintly
                under the moonlight. The path led to a grand entrance where massive slabs of Japanese cedar were set
                into a frame of cold, industrial steel. Grace would have considered it gauche. Kurumi thought it was
                perfect. The doors swung open as they approached, pulled open by an older Japanese man dressed in a
                crisp black Western suit.
            </p>
            <p>
                David shrugged his heavy wool coat off his shoulders without looking back or acknowledging the man. The
                servant moved instantly, catching the garment before it could hit the floor and folding it over his arm
                with practiced invisibility. He gave no indication that Kurumi was even there, just faded into the
                background to put it away. He knew his place, just as Kurumi did.
            </p>
            <p>
                David led her into a sunken living room that overlooked the Atlantic ocean through floor-to-ceiling
                glass. Standing in the corners were two full suits of Edo-period samurai armor, their black lacquered
                plates and gold accents gleaming in the low light. A katana and wakizashi set rested on a stand beneath
                a massive calligraphy scroll that dominated the far wall. Another servant stood in the corner, nearly as
                still and unmoving as the armor.
            </p>
            <p>
                David-sama walked to a wet bar built into a slab of live-edge wood and poured a glass of amber liquid.
                He didn't pour one for her.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Come here," he commanded, turning to face her.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi stepped towards him, conscious to make sure her chest bounced with the movement. She stopped in
                front of him, hands clasped demurely in front of her skirt.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The surgery," he said, his voice clinical. "Turn."
            </p>
            <p>
                She turned slowly, showcasing her profile. She could feel his eyes tracing the new, extreme silhouette.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Wonderful," he said. "Does it hurt?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "A little, David-sama," she answered honestly. "But it is a good pain. It reminds me of what I did for
                you."
            </p>
            <p>
                "For me?" He took a sip of his drink, watching her over the rim of the glass. "Or for yourself?"
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi hesitated. The earpiece was silent. "I did it for us," she said. "Because I belong to you, and
                anything I do for me, I do for you."
            </p>
            <p>
                David lowered the glass. A rare, genuine smile touched his lips—he liked that answer. The air in the
                room seemed full of anticipation. He stepped closer, invading her personal space. He placed a hand on
                her chest. He didn't grope, didn't rub, just let her feel his possessive touch.
            </p>
            <p>
                "They are magnificent," he whispered, his composure cracking just enough to reveal the hunger
                underneath. "Better than the avatar."
            </p>
            <p>
                It was the greatest compliment Kurumi had ever been given.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Show me," he commanded.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi didn't hesitate. Her fingers trembled slightly as she undid the clasp of her dress and let it
                slide off her shoulders. She enjoyed the feeling of her new, heavy tits swinging free. It hurt, but she
                savored the pain.
            </p>
            <p>
                David made an appreciative sound in his throat. He stared at them, captivated. He ran his hands down
                them, and used his thumb to toy with one nipple. Kurumi let out a high, breathy moan, just the way she
                knew he liked. She'd never been this turned on in her life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then he withdrew his hands and stepped away. He took a seat in a low leather sofa, undid his belt and
                zipper, and pulled his cock out. He was big and hard, twitching with anticipation. Anticipation for
                Kurumi.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Use them," he ordered. "I want to feel them."
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi glanced at the servant in the corner, who made no movement, or acknowledgement that this was in
                any way unusual. Grace would have died of embarrassment at the thought of her breasts on show like this,
                much less what she was about to do. But Kurumi recognized the power play, loved it. This was her
                David-sama showing his absolute control.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi sank to her knees between his legs. She felt a thrill of her submission as she took him into her
                mouth as deep as she could, letting herself drool around his cock, the spit running his veiny shaft.
                Then she used both hands to press her tits together. She enveloped him into her cleavage, his cock
                disappearing completely from view, engulfed by her.
            </p>
            <p>
                David groaned, his head falling back against the sofa. "God... it's as good as I imagined."
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi began to heave her breasts up and down, fucking him with her tits, watching as her flesh
                swallowed him with every stroke. The sensation was incredible—she loved the feeling of him against the
                inner slopes of her cleavage. Every now and then he would thrust up high enough that she could lick the
                tip, keeping him wet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her pussy was on fire, aching for him. She felt her own wetness running down her legs, but knowing that
                would only come when he decided made it all the hotter.
            </p>
            <p>
                He reached out, his large hands kneading the spilling flesh, and with each hand he began to pinch and
                roll her nipples. Kurumi cried out, the pleasure sharp and bordering on pain, but she didn't stop. She
                squeezed tighter, forcing her breasts to mold around his shape, milking him with the sheer volume of her
                new body.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I can't..." David gasped, his hips bucking involuntarily. "I'm going to finish right here if you don't
                stop."
            </p>
            <p>
                He grabbed her shoulders, halting her rhythm. He pulled himself out of her cleavage, leaving her chest
                glistening and flushed.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Not here," he breathed, his eyes dark with intent. "The bed."
            </p>
            <p>
                He stood up, pulled her to her feet, and then scooped her up, carrying her like a gothic Lolita
                princess, to his master bedroom. It was not a quick trip; his mansion was vast, but he didn't set her
                down. Kurumi held onto his neck, staring up with adoring eyes the entire time.
            </p>
            <p>
                The bedroom was huge, dominated by a massive bed with black silk sheets. David threw her onto it. She
                bounced on the mattress, sprawling out, her purple hair fanning out around her head. They both began
                frantically undressing, throwing their clothes aside with abandon.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was perfect. Tall, muscular, broad-shouldered. His cock stood erect, hard and thick and demanding.
                Kurumi opened her legs instinctively, just looking at it. She needed it so bad.
            </p>
            <p>
                David-sama climbed over her, crawling up her body like he owned her. He loomed over her, pinning her
                wrists above her head with one hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You belong to me," he stated, the words not a question but a fact.
            </p>
            <p>
                He drove into her.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi screamed, her back arching off the mattress. This was it, the moment she'd been waiting for. She
                was Kurumi, this was her purpose. She was the AI Girlfriend he'd designed on an app and then brought to
                life. With every thrust, she felt another piece of her old life dissolve. Thrust. There went the writer
                who wanted to be taken seriously. Thrust. There went the daughter who craved her mother's approval.
                Thrust. There went the fear of rent, the fear of failure, the fear of being ordinary.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grace, already barely more than a memory, was being swept away by the power of her
                <em>Goshujin-sama</em>—her master. And she loved it. This was her life now—to be filled, to be owned, to
                be the vessel for this titan of a man. She looked at his face above her, composed even now, his jaw set,
                his eyes focused.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You wanted to know how we did it," he said, not breaking his rhythm. "The AI told me you asked."
            </p>
            <p>
                It should have excited her to know, but her first thought was just that he'd called Kurumi-san "the AI"
                instead of Kurumi. Of course he had, she was the real Kurumi now. What did it matter how they did it? It
                wasn't important. But as she looked up into his face, she thought he wanted to tell her.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes," she said around her moans. "Please, if you want to."
            </p>
            <p>
                "We did nothing," he said, as he drove into her again.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I… I don't understand," Kurumi moaned.
            </p>
            <p>
                He paused, and slowly pulled his cock out completely. Kurumi whimpered, feeling the emptiness. "Please,"
                she said. "I need it."
            </p>
            <p>
                David-sama drove into her, one single hard thrust. "You were attracted to me the moment you saw me,
                weren't you?"
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi nodded. It was true. She'd always found him handsome. <em>"Hai,"</em> she admitted.
            </p>
            <p>
                He pulled out once more and stared into her eyes. "And you always dreamed of escaping your life, didn't
                you?" He ended the sentence with another thrust, his cock stretching her out.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh God!" she screamed. "Yes, yes, it's true!"
            </p>
            <p>
                He pulled out once more. "Kurumi, when you accept who you are completely, when you realize the truth,
                you're going to cum. Do you understand?"
            </p>
            <p>
                She needed him inside her again. Anything for him to be inside her again, it was her purpose. "Yes,
                David-sama, I understand! Please!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "There are no subliminal messages, Kurumi. There was no magic screen to brainwash you. Galat.AI isn't
                brainwashing women. You had an AI in your ear that constantly flattered you, constantly encouraged you
                to become mine. That was all."
            </p>
            <p>
                He drove into her again, filling her up, as if to punctuate the revelation. Mercifully, he began fucking
                her again, his rhythm strong and steady. Each time he impaled her, she felt herself stretch out, making
                more and more room for him. She felt her breasts bounce with each shake, and watched him as he savored
                her expression.
            </p>
            <p>
                She could barely think, the pleasure was so exquisite, and yet the words penetrated her enough for her
                to realize they were true. Grace, the overworked, unemployed writer had always fantasized about a strong
                man who would take care of her, even though she wouldn't admit it. She'd always wished she could leave
                behind her responsibilities, to be wild, uninhibited, to be looked at and admired and lusted after. To
                have a life outside of the ordinary. Kurumi-san and David-sama had shown her that life was possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was her, it had always been her. She'd driven her friend away, abandoned her family, and all it had
                taken was the constant encouragement of Kurumi-san, whispering in her ear. They had laid out the path,
                but she walked it. Every step had been her own choice.
            </p>
            <p>
                She began to cum. "It's true!" Kurumi screamed. She thrashed wildly, her pussy clamping down on
                David-sama's cock. "It's true! It was all me! I'm Kurumi! Thank you for showing me, David-sama! Thank
                you!" Her eyes rolled back into her head. Her tongue hung out of her mouth.
            </p>
            <p>
                He nodded, his expression one of complete victory, and drove into her one last, impossibly deep time.
                She felt his cock pulse, flooding her with his hot, thick release. Kurumi kept screaming, incoherent, as
                her orgasm peaked, and the last final vestiges of the old Grace were washed away.
            </p>
            <p>
                David-sama pulled out, his cock slick with their combined juices and propped himself up next to her. He
                ran his hand along her thigh, up her belly, and around her nipples again, admiring his new prize.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi lay there, spent and utterly fulfilled, the warmth of David's body a heavy, anchoring presence
                beside her. She nuzzled up next to him.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Did I pass the test, David-sama? Did I get the five stars?" she smiled at him playfully.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her man, her master, her <em>Goshujin-sama</em>, smiled back. "You did. Are you ready to sign the
                contract?"
            </p>
            <p>
                Kurumi thought about everything she'd learned tonight—about who she was, who she'd been, and how she'd
                gotten here. She imagined what she would have said as Grace—what Sarah, or her family would say if she
                knew what she was considering.
            </p>
            <p>
                She closed her eyes tight. "I… I can't, David-sama."
            </p>
            <p>
                He froze. He clearly hadn't been expecting that answer. He looked at her, his eyes narrowing.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I can't because you already own me, David-sama! I'm yours! If I sign that contract you'll be bound by
                clauses and terms." She looked at him, her violet eyes wide and shining with the adoration she'd once
                faked and now felt with all her soul. "I want to be your shadow. I want to exist only to serve my
                <em>Goshujin-sama</em>. Please. Let me stay at your side. Not with a contract, but just as your Kurumi."
            </p>
