<p>Author’s Note: This story stands on its own though it does follow a minor character from another story of mine. Part 1 is a re-telling of the events of <em>Using Master PC For Self-Improvement</em> from River’s perspective, and thus skippable if you’re so inclined. Parts 2 and 3 are wholly new. <em>Using Master PC For Self-Improvement</em> will be back next week with Part 8.</p>
<p>River heard the woman walk in before she saw her. If River had known what was to come, that the click of those platform heels against the tile were counting down the last seconds of her life, she would have run. But she didn’t know that, of course, so she put down her nail file and walked to the front of the nail salon to greet the customer. </p>
<p>She was blonde. That was the first thing River noticed. She was very aggressively blonde with clothes to match. The tight white tube top, the short skirt, the ridiculous platform heels—it was all so loud. So <em>basic</em>.</p>
<p>River was tired. It wasn’t even noon and she was already exhausted. She was currently dissociating, wishing the world would just stop dragging her down. She felt like she was just treading water these days, barely keeping her chin above the surface while life flowed past.</p>
<p>“Do you have an appointment?” River asked. Her voice sounded flat, even to her own ears.</p>
<p>“Uh, no,” the woman answered.</p>
<p>River sighed internally. She considered giving the blonde her 2:00 slot, or maybe just using that time for an extended break. </p>
<p>“GIVE ME THE NEXT SLOT. BUMP EVERYONE ELSE BACK,” the blonde said.</p>
<p>River’s finger hovered over the keyboard, ready to give her the standard “we’re fully booked” speech. But then, she hesitated.</p>
<p>She looked at the 12:30 slot. Mrs. Gable. She always complained about the water temperature and tipped exactly two dollars. If River took this pampered princess, that could be a huge ticket. Way better commission. And honestly? She really didn’t want to deal with Mrs. Gable today. She could just call her, say we had a scheduling issue, and push her to tomorrow. Yeah, River realized, that actually worked way better.</p>
<p>“You know what?” River said. “I think I can make that work. I’m just finishing up with my current customer now. You’re next.”</p>
<p>The woman was sitting in River’s chair ten minutes later.</p>
<p>“I’m River,” she told the customer. “I’ll be taking care of you today.”</p>
<p>“I’m… Candy,” the blonde said with a little hesitation.</p>
<p>Candy. Of course it was. She probably had a boyfriend named Chad.</p>
<p>They talked a bit and settled on services. White acrylics and a pedicure. <em>Jackpot</em>, thought River. She was definitely going to get a good tip from this.</p>
<p>River started the prep work, soaking the client’s feet and filing her nails. Candy spent the first part of the appointment glued to her phone, checking Instagram. River watched Candy’s reflection in the mirror—the unworried smile, the way she preened. It must be nice, River considered, to have nothing to worry about except likes.</p>
<p>She worked on Candy’s nails, giving her the ridiculous long acrylics she’d asked for, and moved onto the blonde’s feet. River was deep in her own head, scrubbing Candy’s heel, when the customer spoke again.</p>
<p>“I like your nails,” Candy said. “The black isn’t my style, but they really suit you.”</p>
<p>River blinked, surprised she’d even noticed her down here. “Thanks,” she said, glancing at her chipped polish. “Yeah, they’re pretty much my default. Easy to maintain.”</p>
<p>“Do you ever make them more elaborate?”</p>
<p>“Not as often as I’d like. I just don’t feel like doing it for myself when I get home.”</p>
<p>Her mind drifted to home. The messy apartment. The pile of laundry on the chair. And Liam, her boyfriend. She pictured him sitting on the couch playing video games, barely looking up when she walked in. He didn’t care if her nails were black, blue, or falling off.</p>
<p>“Does your boyfriend like them that way?” Candy asked.</p>
<p>River’s hand froze. It was a natural follow-up question, of course, but the timing was so… precise.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t really care, to be honest,” she said as she resumed scrubbing Candy’s feet.</p>
<p>“Ah, boy trouble,” Candy said instantly. “I knew it!“</p>
<p>River glanced up at her customer. “Is it that obvious?” </p>
<p>“Not too obvious, I’m just very… perceptive,” Candy said, her smile widening. “The wrinkled clothes, the faded hair dye. You don’t look like you have someone to impress at home.”</p>
<p>“Well, I shouldn’t have to, right?” River retorted, her tone sharper than she intended. “If I’m in a relationship, the guy should be comfortable with the real me.”</p>
<p>“Oh, River,” Candy sighed. “No! I used to think that way, but being in a relationship means trying to be the best person you can be for your partner!“</p>
<p>River tried to ignore her, scrubbing harder at her heel. It was easy for Candy to say, of course. She probably spent her whole day at the gym or shopping with her husband’s credit card. She didn’t have to work all day for ungrateful clients. </p>
<p>The blonde kept talking, condescending to River about her style, how she was settling, how she should be taking better care of herself. The worst part was, Candy clearly thought she was helping, offering sage advice to River from on high.</p>
<p>River had always liked to think about herself in terms of her namesake. Like a river, she was deep and steady. She didn’t make waves, but she followed her course. She knew who she was, and she didn’t need this condescending bitch telling her she needed to freshen up her image or whatever.</p>
<p>Candy was still talking. “Why are you wearing a plain black t-shirt when you could be showing off that cute figure?” Candy asked, gesturing at River’s stained uniform. “Why let your roots show?”</p>
<p>River opened her mouth to snap at her, to tell her that some of them had real jobs and couldn’t spend three hours a week in a salon chair. But the anger didn’t come out. Instead, the woman’s voice took on a new tone that instantly commanded River’s attention.</p>
<p>“YOU ARE GOING TO START TRYING HARDER. YOU ARE GOING TO EMBRACE YOUR FEMININITY AND YOU ARE GOING TO BE SEXY. REFRESH YOUR HAIR DYE AND LEAN INTO THE ALT-GIRL LOOK. GET SOME CUTE OUTFITS.”</p>
<p>The resentment evaporated instantly. The feeling of injustice vanished. In its place was a sudden, overwhelming realization that Candy was right. River stared at her own reflection in the chrome faucet. <em>I have been making excuses. I’m lazy. I’m gross. I could be better.</em> It felt like she had just woken up from a long, ugly dream.</p>
<p>“You’re right,” River whispered, her voice trembling. “I… I have been letting myself go. I know I’m capable of more.”</p>
<p>“Good girl,” Candy purred.</p>
<p>The praise sent a shiver down River’s spine—half pleasure, half something else. </p>
<p>“Now I just need my boyfriend to start trying too,” River joked weakly, trying to regain some footing as she went back to massaging her feet.</p>
<p>“Do me a favor,” Candy said, ignoring the joke. “Picture your ideal partner and tell me what you see.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know…” River started.</p>
<p>“TRUST ME,” Candy interrupted, her voice once more seeming to echo in River’s head. “I’m a relationship expert.”</p>
<p>“Alright,” River said. The resistance just… wasn’t there.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes. <em>Okay, ideal partner.</em> She tried to picture Liam, but better. <em>Stronger. More attentive.</em> But the image wouldn’t hold. River’s mind kept slipping. She wanted someone who saw her. Someone who appreciated the effort she was about to start making. Someone who wasn’t afraid of… excitement. River wasn’t exciting herself, but maybe that was what she needed. Someone to help get her out of her rut.</p>
<p>The image in her head shifted. The strong hands became slender, manicured. The face softened. It wasn’t a man. It was a woman. A woman who demanded things. It was hard to picture anyone else but Candy right now. The woman’s presence was overpowering.</p>
<p>River’s eyes snapped open. Candy was watching her. She wasn’t smiling politely anymore. She looked hungry. “Who were you picturing?” she asked. “Tell me about them.”</p>
<p>River noticed she said “they” instead of “him.” It was like she knew already—like Candy was staring into River’s soul.</p>
<p>“I guess… someone who sees the real me, you know? Maybe someone who isn’t afraid of excitement.” She didn’t know why she was saying this to a customer. She trusted Candy, of course. But she didn’t know why.</p>
<p>The conversation got more heated. Candy’s voice dropped, as if they were sharing a secret. “You’ve never been with a woman before, have you?”</p>
<p>“That… that’s inappropriate,” River said. This had gone too far. She made a decision. No tip was worth this. She was going to ask Candy to leave.</p>
<p>“YOU WANT THIS,” the blonde said.</p>
<p>On the other hand, hadn’t she just said she needed excitement in her life? And here it was, in the form of a blonde Goddess. <em>Trust me.</em> Candy’s earlier words echoed in her head. Of course she trusted her. </p>
<p>River had always been interested in girls, at least a little. She’d even dated a few before deciding she liked guys more. But this woman was another story. Anyone would want her.</p>
<p>A few minutes later they were in the waxing room, the one private space in the salon. As River shut the door, part of her brain was screaming <em>Run</em> but another part was whispering <em>Kneel.</em> Something was going horribly wrong. But no. She wanted this. Candy had told her so. </p>
<p>“What… what are we doing here?” River asked, though her body was already betraying her, heating up under Candy’s gaze.</p>
<p>Candy stepped closer, her presence filling the small space. She reached out, her manicured fingers ghosting over River’s faded hair.</p>
<p>“We’re making your fantasy real, River,” she murmured.</p>
<p>Candy wasn’t just a customer anymore. She was an event. A force of nature. She ran a sharp nail down River’s cheek, tilting her head back. “First, I want you to tell me what you want to do to me.”</p>
<p>“I… I want to please you,” River said, despite her better judgement.</p>
<p>“Good girl,” Candy purred.</p>
<p>She moved to the leather recliner they used for pedicures and perched on the edge. Her skirt rode up high on her thighs.</p>
<p>“Come here,” Candy commanded, pointing to the floor between her legs.</p>
<p>River’s knees hit the carpet before she made the conscious decision to move. Her stomach fluttered. She tried to say something, to be more of an active participant instead of just taking orders from Candy, but she couldn’t come up with anything.</p>
<p>“Take it off,” Candy said.</p>
<p>River’s fingers trembled as she reached for the skirt, pulling it down slowly. Candy wasn’t wearing panties. The sight of her slick, perfect pussy waiting made River’s mouth water. She looked up at Candy, terrified and exhilarated at what was happening.</p>
<p>Candy just smiled.</p>
<p>River leaned forward. As her mouth touched Candy, a shockwave went through her. River imagined she could feel Candy’s pleasure. Not just hear her gasp, but <em>feel</em> the spike of sensation as if it were happening to her own body.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the realization of what she was doing hit her. This wasn’t her, she didn’t have wild sex in back rooms. River tried to pull back, to stop what she was doing. Part of her wanted to stand up, to run out of the room, to scream for help. But the rest of her wanted it more than anything she’d ever wanted before. </p>
<p><em>I’m crazy,</em> River realized. <em>That’s it. I’m having a psychotic break. The stress, the exhaustion… I finally snapped.</em></p>
<p>It was the only explanation that made sense. She was just a tired nail tech who had lost her mind in a waxing room with a customer. This woman, this <em>Candy</em>, had just seen through her defenses so effortlessly that River had crumbled.</p>
<p>River had felt like her path was fixed. The river of her life had forged deep channels, and she followed them every day. But a flood could make a river overflow its banks, she knew. It could make a river change its shape forever. </p>
<p>This pleasure was that flood, drowning out everything else. Every moan from Candy sent a spike of dopamine through River’s nervous system, reinforcing the behavior she was desperate to stop. It felt like River’s psyche had jumped the banks, flowing into Candy’s mind, taking on the blonde’s shape instead of her own.</p>
<p>Candy was losing control too. She tore off her tube top, her breasts swinging free. River watched, mesmerized, as the blonde woman played with her own nipples. It was a vision of raw, uninhibited desire that River had never allowed herself to feel. Candy was shaking, cumming hard. She squirted in River’s mouth, and River lapped it up.</p>
<p>Finally, Candy was done. River collapsed back on her heels, panting, her face wet with Candy’s juices.</p>
<p>“Oh my god,” Candy gasped. “You… you were perfect.”</p>
<p>She pulled River up, kissing her hard, her tongue claiming River’s mouth. “I told you,” she whispered against River’s lips. “You just needed a little push.”</p>
<p>River stared at her, wide-eyed and trembling. She felt drained out, scraped clean. </p>
<p>Candy’s eyes shone with a wild, possessive light. “I want to see all of you now. Take off your clothes.”</p>
<p>Right. She was still clothed, River realized. She hadn’t gotten undressed at all. That was so wrong. She needed to get naked for Candy.</p>
<p>River stripped. Jeans, t-shirt, bra, panties—they all ended up in a pile on the floor. She moved like an automaton. She was scared, this was so unlike her. <em>You want this,</em> Candy’s voice echoed in her mind. Right. She’d forgotten. For a moment, she’d almost thought she didn’t. River stood there, naked and shivering, feeling exposed in a way she never had before.</p>
<p>“You’re beautiful, River,” Candy said.</p>
<p>River wanted to cry. She wanted to scream that she wasn’t beautiful, she was broken. Candy had said it herself, she needed to try harder. She had been letting herself go, settling. But when she opened her mouth, all that came out was a soft whimper.</p>
<p>“Lie down on the table,” Candy commanded.</p>
<p>River climbed onto the velvet waxing bed. Candy went to her purse and pulled out a black dildo. It looked huge.</p>
<p>Candy straddled her. The weight of Candy’s body on her hips was grounding, heavy. She pressed the toy against River, and River gasped.</p>
<p>“You’re going to enjoy this for me,” Candy said.</p>
<p>As she pushed it in, the world dissolved. It hurt, just a little, a stretch that felt like being opened up, but the pain was instantly swallowed by a flood of pleasure that didn’t feel entirely River’s own.</p>
<p><em>She is so beautiful. She told me to try harder. I’ll try harder for her, do anything she wants.</em></p>
<p>The thoughts echoed in the empty space where River’s own will used to be. She tried to find the old River, the cynical, tired girl who hated her job, but she was gone.</p>
<p><em>Help me,</em> River thought, a final plea to a universe that wasn’t listening. She bucked her hips, meeting Candy’s thrusts.</p>
<p><em>Faster. Harder. Take me.</em></p>
<p>River couldn’t tell if Candy was saying it or thinking it, or if she was begging for it herself. It didn’t matter. They were a closed loop. Candy’s desire fed hers, River’s submission fed Candy’s.</p>
<p>River looked up at her face. Candy looked vacant, lost in the sensation, but her eyes were locked on River’s.</p>
<p><em>I’m cheating on Liam,</em> a tiny, frantic part of River’s brain whispered, the last gasp of her old self. <em>I’m cheating on my boyfriend with a stranger. I’m insane. I’ve lost my mind.</em></p>
<p>But the guilt was burned away by the heat of the moment. The shame was there, but it only made the surrender sweeter.</p>
<p><em>Trust me. I’m a relationship expert.</em> </p>
<p>Candy’s voice, or the memory of it, swirled in River’s mind, mixing with the pounding rhythm of the sex. Yes. She trusted Candy.</p>
<p><em>You are going to embrace your femininity. You are going to be sexy.</em></p>
<p>Yes, she would be sexy. This was sexy. What could be more sexy than this? This goddess, fucking her with a dildo?</p>
<p><em>You want this.</em> Of course she did. River sobbed, her body convulsing around the toy. Of course she wanted this. Candy had said it, so it was true.</p>
<p><em>Be sexy. Trust Candy. You want this. Be Sexy.</em> The words echoed in her head, over and over.</p>
<p>“I am yours,” River sobbed as the orgasm built, a terrifying flood poised to drown her. She didn’t think Candy could hear her, she was so lost in the moment. It didn’t matter. A prayer was a prayer, even if her Goddess didn’t hear it.</p>
<p>River came. The waters leapt their banks, forging a new channel in her mind.</p>
