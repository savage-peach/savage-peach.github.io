<p>It had only been two days since the blonde woman, Candy, had walked into the nail salon and turned River’s world upside down. Two days since River had been dragged into the waxing room and taken apart, then put back together in the shape of… of <em>Her.</em></p>
<p>River stared at her reflection in the mirror of her small, cluttered apartment. The woman’s voice was still bouncing around in her head. <em>Refresh your hair dye,</em> the woman had said. And River had obeyed. Her hair was now a vibrant, electric blue, the black roots gone. <em>Lean into the alt-girl look. Get some cute outfits</em>. River had spent money she didn’t really have on new clothes: plaid skirts, black boots, silver jewelry.</p>
<p>She had sent pictures of herself wearing them to Candy, hoping for her approval. She tried to sound light, flirty, like she wasn’t as obsessed as she felt. River desperately wanted to see Candy again. No, <em>needed</em> to. But Candy had a boyfriend, apparently. Of course she did. Probably a rich sugar daddy. River didn’t care, she’d take Candy any way she could get her. She’d asked Candy for a threesome. It had sounded like it was going to happen, but then River’s world had been shattered. The boyfriend had said no. </p>
<p>Of course he had. He must know how broken River was. Surely, Candy had told him about River, told him what she had seen: a faded mess of a woman who didn’t try. </p>
<p>Those were the words that echoed most in River’s head. <em>You are going to start trying harder.</em> She hadn’t realized how little she was trying—how insufficient she had been—until Candy had told her.</p>
<p>She was trying now. River admired her new outfit in the mirror. She wore a mesh top with a corset over it, a black-and-blue plaid skirt, and chunky knee-high boots. She looked sexy. She knew it because the mirror told her so, and because the memory of Candy’s voice insisted on it. <em>You are going to be sexy.</em> She focused on her chest, where the sheer fabric highlighted the curve of her breasts. She could almost swear they looked bigger, fuller than they had been. They strained against the material as if swelling to meet the new demands of her femininity. Her face looked different too. It was sultry, more alluring somehow. Maybe it was the unending need she felt coming to the surface. </p>
<p>“You look great, babe,” Liam said from the couch. He didn’t look up from his video game. “Did you do something different with your makeup?”</p>
<p>River felt a spike of irritation. Liam was fine. He was <em>fine</em>. He was safe, and boring, and he touched her like he was handling groceries.</p>
<p>“I changed <em>everything</em>, Liam,” River snapped. She walked over to the TV and stood in front of it.</p>
<p>He blinked, looking up, controller still in hand. “Oh. Yeah. That outfit. Man, that’s a sexy outfit.” He patted the cushion next to him, inviting her to sit.</p>
<p>River stared at him. He was soft around the edges, his t-shirt worn, his eyes tired and vacant of any real fire. But he was here.  She needed to feel it again. That surrender. That flood of intense sensation that could cut new channels in the bedrock of her soul. Maybe she didn’t need <em>Her</em>. Maybe she just needed the act.</p>
<p>“Put the controller down,” River said. Her voice was sharp.</p>
<p>Liam hesitated, sensing that something was wrong. “River?”</p>
<p>She didn’t answer. She straddled his lap, pushing him back against the couch. She didn’t kiss him gently; she mashed her mouth against his, grinding her hips into his crotch.</p>
<p>“Touch me,” she commanded. “Like you own me.”</p>
<p>“Woah, okay,” Liam answered, surprised but clearly not complaining. His hands squeezed her, but he was hesitant. Careful.</p>
<p>She broke the kiss and glared down at him. “No. Harder. Don’t ask. Just take it.”</p>
<p>She reached down, fumbling with his belt, undoing his jeans with frantic, jerky movements. She needed him inside her. She needed to be filled up, hoping that the sensation would plug the void in her soul where her self-worth used to be. <em>You are going to start trying harder</em>, the command echoed in her head. </p>
<p>Liam helped her pull his pants off, his erection springing free. River didn’t wait for foreplay. She lifted her hips and sank down onto him in one smooth motion. She wasn’t wearing any panties because Candy hadn’t. <em>Be sexy.</em> That’s what a sexy girl should do, right? </p>
<p>“Ow!” Liam gasped, his hands coming up to hold her waist. She wasn’t very wet. It hurt for her too, but that didn’t matter. “River, babe, slow down.”</p>
<p>River glared. “Don’t tell me to slow down.” She began to ride him, her pussy quickly lubricating itself due to the friction, if not any real arousal. She set a punishing pace and closed her eyes tight, blocking out the sight of the messy living room, the paused video game, Liam’s confused face. In her mind’s eye, she tried to imagine Liam’s hands as perfectly manicured, sharp-nailed claws, his grunts as her soft, commanding purrs, and his insufficient erection as a strap-on worn by a blonde goddess.</p>
<p>“Pull my hair,” River ordered as she bounced on him.</p>
<p>Liam complied, his fingers tangling in her blue bob-cut. He tugged, but it was a gentle pull, not what she needed.</p>
<p>“Harder!” River screamed, impaling herself with more force. “Pull it like you hate me! Make me feel it!“</p>
<p><em>Start trying harder</em>, the voice whispered in her mind, relentless and demanding. <em>Be sexy.</em> </p>
<p>Liam jerked her head back, harder this time, startled by her intensity. “River, what has gotten into you?”</p>
<p>“Just fuck me! Tell me I’m yours! Tell me what I am!“</p>
<p>Liam was moving with her now, thrusting upward, but the rhythm was all wrong. It was clumsy. It was human.</p>
<p>“You’re… you’re my girl?” Liam said, but it sounded like a question. It sounded ridiculous coming from him. There was no weight to it. No magic.</p>
<p>River squeezed her eyes shut tighter. It wasn’t working. The physical sensation was there: the friction, the stretching. But she wasn’t drowning in his lust. She wasn’t submitting. She was just having rough sex on a futon with a guy who didn’t realize how broken she was.</p>
<p>She tried to fantasize about the waxing room. The cold air. The smell of acetone. The blonde woman towering over her.</p>
<p><em>Trust me</em>, the voice in her head said. <em>You want this.</em> She wanted it. But not this, not with Liam. She wanted Candy. </p>
<p>River came, but it was purely mechanical. A spasm of muscles that did nothing to fill the emptiness inside. Still, it was enough for Liam to spurt inside her, and that was something. <em>Embrace your femininity</em>. What could be more feminine than having a man cum inside you? She hoped Candy would approve.</p>
<p>Liam wrapped his arms around her, stroking her back. “Wow,” he breathed, misinterpreting her desperation for passion. “That was… intense. You really wanted me, huh?”</p>
<p>She didn’t, she realized. This wasn’t it. He wasn’t <em>Her</em>. He couldn’t fill her up. He couldn’t even see how empty she was.</p>
<p>She climbed off him, pulling her skirt down.</p>
<p>“River?” Liam sat up, confused by the sudden retreat. “Babe, are you okay?”</p>
<p>“I can’t,” River choked out. She felt suffocated. The apartment was too small. Liam was too small. “I can’t do this.”</p>
<p>“Can’t do what? We just…”</p>
<p>“I need to go,” River said, grabbing her purse. She needed air. She needed to find the source. She couldn’t live like this.</p>
<p>“River, it’s ten o’clock!” Liam called after her, pulling his pants up. “Where are you going?”</p>
<p>“I need cigarettes,” she said, slamming the door behind her. She didn’t smoke. But she was starting to feel like she was burning up inside.</p>
<p>River fled down the cracked concrete stairs of her apartment complex and climbed into her car. It was an old sedan—the body was a faded red, clashing with the jet-black replacement hood. For River, it was just a way to get from Point A to Point B, though tonight she didn’t even know where Point B was.</p>
<p>She pulled out her phone and typed “bar” into Google Maps. She scrolled past the family “bar and grill” type places and the dive bars that an “alt-girl” wouldn’t be caught dead in. One caught her eye, it was called “Prohibition.” It looked trendy. </p>
<p>She pulled up 15 minutes later. There was plenty of street parking—it was a Tuesday, after all. Stepping out, she smoothed down her skirt. The night air was cool against her legs, but she barely felt it.</p>
<p>Inside, the atmosphere was thick and dark. Red lights cast shadows on the exposed brick walls and a slow, thumping industrial beat vibrated through the floorboards. It was mostly dead. A couple of bartenders were chatting near the taps, and a few scattered patrons nursed drinks in the booths.</p>
<p>River hoisted herself onto a barstool, the mesh of her top itching against her skin and ordered a drink.</p>
<p>A man was sitting a few stools down, hunched over a notebook, a half-finished beer next to him. He was lean, wearing a brown leather jacket over a white t-shirt, his dark hair messy in a way that took effort. Silver rings glinted on his fingers as he tapped a pen against the bar.</p>
<p>He looked up at River, their eyes making contact. She noticed his eyes were dark and rimmed with fatigue. Or maybe just eyeliner.</p>
<p>“Slow night,” he said, gesturing to the mostly empty room.</p>
<p>“Well, it is a school night,” River noted dryly.</p>
<p>“Yeah, true. Keeps the college crowd away. I’m Seth, by the way.” He didn’t extend a hand, just tilted his beer bottle toward her in a mock toast.</p>
<p>“I’m River,” she said. She leaned forward, the corset pushing her breasts up. In the red light, her skin looked pale, almost porcelain. His eyes flicked down to her chest, then back up to her blue hair. <em>Be sexy</em>. She pushed her chest out a little further.</p>
<p>“River. Yeah, that fits,” Seth said, his gaze lingering on her hair. “You look like you just walked out of a music video. Or a graphic novel.”</p>
<p>“I’m trying,” River said. The words tumbled out before she could stop them. “I’m trying harder.” She moved to the seat next to him.</p>
<p>Seth raised an eyebrow, intrigued. “Harder than what? Most people here just try to look like they don’t care.”</p>
<p>River stared at him. She felt the desperate, clawing need in her gut. She couldn’t do this ironic detachment. Every second spent talking was a second she wasn’t being validated.</p>
<p>“Do you think I’m sexy?” River asked.</p>
<p>Seth smiled. “I mean, yeah. Obviously. You’ve got to know you’re sexy.”</p>
<p>River nodded. “OK,” she said, coming to a decision, “Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Go… where?” Seth asked.</p>
<p>“To your place.”</p>
<p>Seth choked on his beer, a sharp cough escaping before he could cover his mouth. He wiped his lips with the back of his hand. “Woah. Are you… you serious? We haven’t even finished a drink.”</p>
<p>River picked up her drink and downed it all at once, setting it back on the counter. “I don’t want a drink. I want you to take me home and fuck me.”</p>
<p>Seth hesitated, his smile gone, replaced by a wary assessment. He looked like he was trying to figure out if she was a cop, crazy, or just trouble. “Look, River, you’re hot, but you seem… I don’t know. Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine,” River lied. “I’m just… I’m going through something. I think I just left my boyfriend. I just need this. I don’t want a date. I don’t want to talk about art or music or whatever you were going to hit on me with. I just want to feel it. I need to know I’m alive. That I’m good enough.”</p>
<p>Seth looked at her for a long moment. “You’re a little crazy, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Maybe,” River answered. “Is that a ‘no’?”</p>
<p>“No. It’s definitely not a ‘no’”. Another moment of hesitation. “OK, let’s go.” They stood up together and River followed him out to his car.</p>
<p>The drive was a blur of streetlights in silence. Seth drove an older model EV. He tried to make conversation once, asking where she was from, but River just stared out the window, her nails digging into her palms. She couldn’t talk. Talking would break the spell. She had to stay in the headspace. She had to be ready. <em>Be sexy. You want this.</em> She wanted it so, so bad.</p>
<p>They arrived at a converted warehouse building. Seth lived in a loft on the third floor. It was messy in an artistic way—canvases stacked against the walls, records scattered on the floor, a mattress on a pallet in the corner.</p>
<p>The moment the door shut, River dove into him. She pushed him back against the wall, kissing him hard. They stumbled towards his mattress, undressing each other as they went. He was lean and wiry, but in good shape. He had the body of a cyclist or something. The most important thing was that his dick was hard. For her. </p>
<p>Her outfit was harder to get out of than his. Taking off the skirt was easy, but the corset had a lot of lacing. Somehow, in the end her see-through mesh top was all that remained. He started to pull it off, but she stopped him. “No, I want to wear this,” she said. “I… I need part of the outfit.” <em>Get some cute outfits. Lean into the alt-girl look.</em></p>
<p>“OK,” he said, clearly not understanding but not wanting to ask questions anymore either. </p>
<p>River lay on her back and Seth took her breasts in his hands, gently at first, kneading them through the sheer mesh of her top. She was sure they were larger than they had been last week. Was that possible? The thought was obliterated when he began sucking on them. Oh God. They were more sensitive too. He shifted, his tongue circling the nipple through the soft, thin material, and then he pulled the mesh down slightly, tearing a small rip in his haste. She reached up and ripped the top further, allowing him easy access. Seth took as much of her breast into his mouth as he could. River moaned encouragement as his tongue swirled around her nipple, the pleasure a momentary distraction from the void.</p>
<p>“Harder,” she said. “Bite them, pull them. Oh god, just take me.”</p>
<p>Seth obeyed, his teeth nibbling the sensitive skin. River arched her back, pushing her chest harder into Seth’s mouth and ran her hands down his back. It felt so good. She didn’t know it could feel this good. <em>You want this.</em> She felt his hand slide down between her thighs, felt his finger as he touched her clit, felt the electricity of it shoot through her body.</p>
<p>“Holy shit you’re wet,” he said. She was. She was so turned on. Why was she so much more turned on than she had been with Liam? They were both men, both ready to fuck her. But she knew Candy would approve of this liaison with Seth so much more. Why?</p>
<p>“I’m wet for you,” River answered in her most sultry voice. <em>Be sexy. Lean into your femininity.</em> Of course. She shouldn’t just be lying here, she needed to be as sexy as she could.</p>
<p>River grabbed his hair and gently pulled him away from her nipples so she could make eye contact again. She licked her lips and gave him her sexiest look. “I want you so bad. Please, put your cock inside me.”</p>
<p>Seth nodded. “One sec, just let me grab a condom.” He fished his wallet out of his pants and pulled out a wrapper. It was one of the “ribbed for her pleasure” types.</p>
<p>“It’s OK,” River said purring. “You can fuck me raw. I don’t mind.”</p>
<p>Seth hesitated. “Thanks. But I just like to be safe. I don’t want a surprise in nine months, you know?” he explained as he put it on. But River knew that wasn’t the only reason. She was a strange woman he’d just taken home. He was probably worried about STDs. Probably thought River was a slut. The thought just got her hotter.</p>
<p>Seth climbed on top of her. Unlike Liam’s hesitant approach, Seth was deliberate, his weight heavy, pressing her into the thin mattress. River wrapped her legs around him, inviting him in and he responded by sinking into her slowly and deliberately. River gasped, the sensation of his fullness feeling right, somehow. <em>You are going to be sexy.</em> Her mind repeated the mantra. <em>You are going to try harder.</em> She was trying, desperately. Was this what Candy wanted? She knew it was. Seth began to move, slow, deep, and steady. River focused on the feeling, the friction, the expression of pleasure on Seth’s face. She felt like such a slut.</p>
<p>“Unnnngh. Yeah, God, that’s it,” River said. She knew, somehow, that being a slut was important. It wasn’t one of the commands Candy had given her, but it was somehow the underlying theme of them all. It was the Grand Unified Theory of her Goddess’s orders. River knew this with a certainty that wasn’t her own. When she had been in that waxing room, something had happened. It wasn’t that Candy’s mind had invaded hers, it was the opposite. River’s thoughts had entered Candy’s mind, but Candy’s lust had been incandescent. No human mind could survive contact with that much sexual heat. River felt like her brain had been melted down and poured into a new mold to set. Her sexuality—her very being—was now Candy-shaped, somehow.</p>
<p>His thrusts began to pick up speed. <em>Refresh your hair dye. Lean into the alt-girl look.</em> Of course, so that men—and women—would find her sexy. <em>Get some cute outfits.</em> Outfits for people to look at her, outfits to let them know she was available. <em>Be sexy.</em> Yes, what could be sexier than fucking? </p>
<p>Seth picked up the pace, kneading at her tits. “Is this what you want?” he asked, tiptoeing into some dirty talk.</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” River moaned. “Oh god. Ungghhh. Please, tell me I’m sexy.”</p>
<p>“Fuck, River, you’re fucking gorgeous. You’re the sexiest woman I’ve ever been with.”</p>
<p>The words got River closer. She felt her orgasm building. She’d never been this wet before—she could feel her juices running out of her pussy, a wet spot beneath her that grew bigger with each thrust. She was so wet she wasn’t getting enough friction. The ribbing on the condom helped, but what helped even more was the validation.</p>
<p>She needed more. “Oh God, yes. And… was my outfit cute?” </p>
<p>This one caught Seth a little by surprise, but he was game. “So cute, River. You look like a manic pixie dream girl.” He was going faster now. <em>Be sexy.</em> She felt her tits bouncing with each thrust. River wanted to grab them, to pinch her own nipples, but she wanted Seth to watch them more, because that meant she was being sexy. Instead she wrapped one arm beneath them, helping them bounce as he fucked her.</p>
<p>“Tell me I’m trying hard enough. Tell me… tell me what I am.”</p>
<p>“God, River, I don’t think you could try any harder. You’re trying hard enough.”</p>
<p>But she knew she wasn’t. It didn’t feel right. <em>You’re going to start trying harder.</em> How could he say she was trying hard enough when Candy had said she wasn’t? She wrapped her legs around him, arched her back, tried to look as sexy as possible as he fucked her. He pumped in and out faster, harder. It felt so good. But it still wasn’t what she needed. </p>
<p>“No, I’m not. Tell me what I am. I need to know. What I ammmmm,” her sentence trailed off into moans.</p>
<p>“Oh God, River, I’m gonna cum. You’re… I don’t know. You’re crazy. You’re beautiful and crazy and hot and you clearly have low self-esteem.”</p>
<p>“I know!” she screamed, clutching at Seth’s shoulders, her nails digging into his skin. “I’m broken! I’m a broken mess! I’m not good enough! I’m nothing without her!” That was it. That was the truth. She felt her pussy gripping him harder, she was so close.</p>
<p>“Is that what you want to hear? That you’re not good enough?”</p>
<p>“Yes! Just like she said!” River yelled.</p>
<p>“Fine. Then you’re not good enough. You’re worthless,” he paused, waiting for her reaction.</p>
<p>“I know I am, keep talking!“</p>
<p>“You’re a worthless slut who needs men. Who gets dressed up to go out and fuck guys because you know that’s the only thing you’re good for! Is that what you want to hear, slut?”</p>
<p>River didn’t answer with words, just an unintelligible moan that tore loose from her throat as she came, trashing wildly beneath him. She wrapped her legs around him as tight as she could, dug her fingernails into his back. She felt her pussy gripping his cock like a vise, her spasms coaxing Seth to his own climax. Seth groaned and bucked against her, and she felt his cock pulse even through the condom. </p>
<p>He collapsed onto her, panting, his forehead resting on her shoulder. “You’re… you’re definitely <em>something</em>, River,” he managed.</p>
<p>River shifted her position on the mattress so she wasn’t lying in a puddle of her own juices and curled up next to Seth. She lay there in the afterglow, knowing she’d done something Candy would approve of. And for a moment, she thought she’d found what she needed. </p>
<p>“Can I sleep here?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Of course,” Seth said. “Yeah, of course.”</p>
<p>She lay with him in the bed. He tried to make small talk, tried to get to know her. River did her best to seem normal, but her mind kept drifting back to <em>Her.</em> She felt the emptiness inside returning. <em>You are going to start trying harder,</em> the voice still whispered. River was beginning to worry that no matter how hard she tried, it would never be enough. The voice would always be there, pushing her. Not until Candy told her she could stop.</p>
