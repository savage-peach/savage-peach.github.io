# River Erosion

## Author's Note

This story is in the same universe as [Using Master PC For Self-Improvement](https://savage-peach.github.io/stories/using-master-pc/) and, in fact, Part 1 is a retelling of one chapter from it. There is no correct order to read the two in, but if you read this first and want to know Candy's backstory, then perhaps it should be your next stop.

## The Blonde

River heard the woman walk in before she saw her. If River had known what was to come, that the click of those platform heels against the tile were counting down the last seconds of her life, she would have run. But she didn't know that, of course, so she put down her nail file and walked to the front of the nail salon to greet the customer. 

She was blonde. That was the first thing River noticed. She was very aggressively blonde with clothes to match. The tight white tube top, the short skirt, the ridiculous platform heels—it was all so loud. So *basic*.

River was tired. It wasn’t even noon and she was already exhausted. She was currently dissociating, wishing the world would just stop dragging her down. She felt like she was just treading water these days, barely keeping her chin above the surface while life flowed past.

"Do you have an appointment?" River asked. Her voice sounded flat, even to her own ears.

"Uh, no," the woman answered.

River sighed internally. She considered giving the blonde her 2:00 slot, or maybe just using that time for an extended break. 

"GIVE ME THE NEXT SLOT. BUMP EVERYONE ELSE BACK," the blonde said.

River’s finger hovered over the keyboard, ready to give her the standard "we're fully booked" speech. But then, she hesitated.

She looked at the 12:30 slot. Mrs. Gable. She always complained about the water temperature and tipped exactly two dollars. If River took this pampered princess, that could be a huge ticket. Way better commission. And honestly? She really didn't want to deal with Mrs. Gable today. She could just call her, say we had a scheduling issue, and push her to tomorrow. Yeah, River realized, that actually worked way better.

"You know what?" River said. "I think I can make that work. I’m just finishing up with my current customer now. You’re next."

The woman was sitting in River's chair ten minutes later.

"I’m River," she told the customer. "I'll be taking care of you today."

"I’m... Candy," the blonde said with a little hesitation.

Candy. Of course it was. She probably had a boyfriend named Chad.

They talked a bit and settled on services. White acrylics and a pedicure. *Jackpot*, thought River. She was definitely going to get a good tip from this.

River started the prep work, soaking the client's feet and filing her nails. Candy spent the first part of the appointment glued to her phone, checking Instagram. River watched Candy's reflection in the mirror—the unworried smile, the way she preened. It must be nice, River considered, to have nothing to worry about except likes.

She worked on Candy's nails, giving her the ridiculous long acrylics she'd asked for, and moved onto the blonde's feet. River was deep in her own head, scrubbing Candy’s heel, when the customer spoke again.

"I like your nails," Candy said. "The black isn't my style, but they really suit you."

River blinked, surprised she’d even noticed her down here. "Thanks," she said, glancing at her chipped polish. "Yeah, they're pretty much my default. Easy to maintain."

"Do you ever make them more elaborate?"

"Not as often as I'd like. I just don't feel like doing it for myself when I get home."

Her mind drifted to home. The messy apartment. The pile of laundry on the chair. And Liam, her boyfriend. She pictured him sitting on the couch playing video games, barely looking up when she walked in. He didn't care if her nails were black, blue, or falling off.

"Does your boyfriend like them that way?" Candy asked.

River’s hand froze. It was a natural follow-up question, of course, but the timing was so… precise.

"He doesn't really care, to be honest," she said as she resumed scrubbing Candy's feet.

"Ah, boy trouble," Candy said instantly. "I knew it\!"

River glanced up at her customer. "Is it that obvious?" 

"Not too obvious, I'm just very… perceptive," Candy said, her smile widening. "The wrinkled clothes, the faded hair dye. You don't look like you have someone to impress at home."

"Well, I shouldn't have to, right?" River retorted, her tone sharper than she intended. "If I'm in a relationship, the guy should be comfortable with the real me."

"Oh, River," Candy sighed. "No\! I used to think that way, but being in a relationship means trying to be the best person you can be for your partner\!"

River tried to ignore her, scrubbing harder at her heel. It was easy for Candy to say, of course. She probably spent her whole day at the gym or shopping with her husband's credit card. She didn't have to work all day for ungrateful clients. 

The blonde kept talking, condescending to River about her style, how she was settling, how she should be taking better care of herself. The worst part was, Candy clearly thought she was helping, offering sage advice to River from on high.

River had always liked to think about herself in terms of her namesake. Like a river, she was deep and steady. She didn't make waves, but she followed her course. She knew who she was, and she didn't need this condescending bitch telling her she needed to freshen up her image or whatever.

Candy was still talking. "Why are you wearing a plain black t-shirt when you could be showing off that cute figure?" Candy asked, gesturing at River's stained uniform. "Why let your roots show?"

River opened her mouth to snap at her, to tell her that some of them had real jobs and couldn't spend three hours a week in a salon chair. But the anger didn't come out. Instead, the woman's voice took on a new tone that instantly commanded River's attention.

"YOU ARE GOING TO START TRYING HARDER. YOU ARE GOING TO EMBRACE YOUR FEMININITY AND YOU ARE GOING TO BE SEXY. REFRESH YOUR HAIR DYE AND LEAN INTO THE ALT-GIRL LOOK. GET SOME CUTE OUTFITS."

The resentment evaporated instantly. The feeling of injustice vanished. In its place was a sudden, overwhelming realization that Candy was right. River stared at her own reflection in the chrome faucet. *I have been making excuses. I'm lazy. I'm gross. I could be better.* It felt like she had just woken up from a long, ugly dream.

"You’re right," River whispered, her voice trembling. "I... I have been letting myself go. I know I’m capable of more."

"Good girl," Candy purred.

The praise sent a shiver down River’s spine—half pleasure, half something else. 

"Now I just need my boyfriend to start trying too," River joked weakly, trying to regain some footing as she went back to massaging her feet.

"Do me a favor," Candy said, ignoring the joke. "Picture your ideal partner and tell me what you see."

"I don't know…" River started.

"TRUST ME," Candy interrupted, her voice once more seeming to echo in River's head. "I'm a relationship expert."

"Alright," River said. The resistance just... wasn't there.

She closed her eyes. *Okay, ideal partner.* She tried to picture Liam, but better. *Stronger. More attentive.* But the image wouldn't hold. River’s mind kept slipping. She wanted someone who saw her. Someone who appreciated the effort she was about to start making. Someone who wasn't afraid of... excitement. River wasn't exciting herself, but maybe that was what she needed. Someone to help get her out of her rut.

The image in her head shifted. The strong hands became slender, manicured. The face softened. It wasn't a man. It was a woman. A woman who demanded things. It was hard to picture anyone else but Candy right now. The woman's presence was overpowering.

River’s eyes snapped open. Candy was watching her. She wasn't smiling politely anymore. She looked hungry. "Who were you picturing?" she asked. "Tell me about them."

River noticed she said "they" instead of "him." It was like she knew already—like Candy was staring into River's soul.

"I guess… someone who sees the real me, you know? Maybe someone who isn't afraid of excitement." She didn't know why she was saying this to a customer. She trusted Candy, of course. But she didn't know why.

The conversation got more heated. Candy's voice dropped, as if they were sharing a secret. "You've never been with a woman before, have you?"

"That… that's inappropriate," River said. This had gone too far. She made a decision. No tip was worth this. She was going to ask Candy to leave.

"YOU WANT THIS," the blonde said.

On the other hand, hadn't she just said she needed excitement in her life? And here it was, in the form of a blonde Goddess. *Trust me.* Candy's earlier words echoed in her head. Of course she trusted her. 

River had always been interested in girls, at least a little. She'd even dated a few before deciding she liked guys more. But this woman was another story. Anyone would want her.

A few minutes later they were in the waxing room, the one private space in the salon. As River shut the door, part of her brain was screaming *Run* but another part was whispering *Kneel.* Something was going horribly wrong. But no. She wanted this. Candy had told her so. 

"What... what are we doing here?" River asked, though her body was already betraying her, heating up under Candy’s gaze.

Candy stepped closer, her presence filling the small space. She reached out, her manicured fingers ghosting over River’s faded hair.

"We're making your fantasy real, River," she murmured.

Candy wasn't just a customer anymore. She was an event. A force of nature. She ran a sharp nail down River’s cheek, tilting her head back. "First, I want you to tell me what you want to do to me."

"I... I want to please you," River said, despite her better judgement.

"Good girl," Candy purred.

She moved to the leather recliner they used for pedicures and perched on the edge. Her skirt rode up high on her thighs.

"Come here," Candy commanded, pointing to the floor between her legs.

River’s knees hit the carpet before she made the conscious decision to move. Her stomach fluttered. She tried to say something, to be more of an active participant instead of just taking orders from Candy, but she couldn't come up with anything.

"Take it off," Candy said.

River’s fingers trembled as she reached for the skirt, pulling it down slowly. Candy wasn't wearing panties. The sight of her slick, perfect pussy waiting made River’s mouth water. She looked up at Candy, terrified and exhilarated at what was happening.

Candy just smiled.

River leaned forward. As her mouth touched Candy, a shockwave went through her. River imagined she could feel Candy’s pleasure. Not just hear her gasp, but *feel* the spike of sensation as if it were happening to her own body.

Suddenly, the realization of what she was doing hit her. This wasn't her, she didn't have wild sex in back rooms. River tried to pull back, to stop what she was doing. Part of her wanted to stand up, to run out of the room, to scream for help. But the rest of her wanted it more than anything she'd ever wanted before. 

*I'm crazy,* River realized. *That’s it. I’m having a psychotic break. The stress, the exhaustion... I finally snapped.*

It was the only explanation that made sense. She was just a tired nail tech who had lost her mind in a waxing room with a customer. This woman, this *Candy*, had just seen through her defenses so effortlessly that River had crumbled.

River had felt like her path was fixed. The river of her life had forged deep channels, and she followed them every day. But a flood could make a river overflow its banks, she knew. It could make a river change its shape forever. 

This pleasure was that flood, drowning out everything else. Every moan from Candy sent a spike of dopamine through River’s nervous system, reinforcing the behavior she was desperate to stop. It felt like River's psyche had jumped the banks, flowing into Candy's mind, taking on the blonde's shape instead of her own.

Candy was losing control too. She tore off her tube top, her breasts swinging free. River watched, mesmerized, as the blonde woman played with her own nipples. It was a vision of raw, uninhibited desire that River had never allowed herself to feel. Candy was shaking, cumming hard. She squirted in River's mouth, and River lapped it up.

Finally, Candy was done. River collapsed back on her heels, panting, her face wet with Candy’s juices.

"Oh my god," Candy gasped. "You... you were perfect."

She pulled River up, kissing her hard, her tongue claiming River’s mouth. "I told you," she whispered against River’s lips. "You just needed a little push."

River stared at her, wide-eyed and trembling. She felt drained out, scraped clean. 

Candy's eyes shone with a wild, possessive light. "I want to see all of you now. Take off your clothes."

Right. She was still clothed, River realized. She hadn't gotten undressed at all. That was so wrong. She needed to get naked for Candy.

River stripped. Jeans, t-shirt, bra, panties—they all ended up in a pile on the floor. She moved like an automaton. She was scared, this was so unlike her. *You want this,* Candy's voice echoed in her mind. Right. She'd forgotten. For a moment, she'd almost thought she didn't. River stood there, naked and shivering, feeling exposed in a way she never had before.

"You're beautiful, River," Candy said.

River wanted to cry. She wanted to scream that she wasn't beautiful, she was broken. Candy had said it herself, she needed to try harder. She had been letting herself go, settling. But when she opened her mouth, all that came out was a soft whimper.

"Lie down on the table," Candy commanded.

River climbed onto the velvet waxing bed. Candy went to her purse and pulled out a black dildo. It looked huge.

Candy straddled her. The weight of Candy’s body on her hips was grounding, heavy. She pressed the toy against River, and River gasped.

"You’re going to enjoy this for me," Candy said.

As she pushed it in, the world dissolved. It hurt, just a little, a stretch that felt like being opened up, but the pain was instantly swallowed by a flood of pleasure that didn't feel entirely River’s own.

*She is so beautiful. She told me to try harder. I'll try harder for her, do anything she wants.*

The thoughts echoed in the empty space where River’s own will used to be. She tried to find the old River, the cynical, tired girl who hated her job, but she was gone.

*Help me,* River thought, a final plea to a universe that wasn't listening. She bucked her hips, meeting Candy’s thrusts.

*Faster. Harder. Take me.*

River couldn't tell if Candy was saying it or thinking it, or if she was begging for it herself. It didn't matter. They were a closed loop. Candy’s desire fed hers, River’s submission fed Candy’s.

River looked up at her face. Candy looked vacant, lost in the sensation, but her eyes were locked on River's.

*I'm cheating on Liam,* a tiny, frantic part of River’s brain whispered, the last gasp of her old self. *I'm cheating on my boyfriend with a stranger. I'm insane. I've lost my mind.*

But the guilt was burned away by the heat of the moment. The shame was there, but it only made the surrender sweeter.

*Trust me. I'm a relationship expert.* 

Candy’s voice, or the memory of it, swirled in River’s mind, mixing with the pounding rhythm of the sex. Yes. She trusted Candy.

*You are going to embrace your femininity. You are going to be sexy.*

Yes, she would be sexy. This was sexy. What could be more sexy than this? This goddess, fucking her with a dildo?

*You want this.* Of course she did. River sobbed, her body convulsing around the toy. Of course she wanted this. Candy had said it, so it was true.

*Be sexy. Trust Candy. You want this. Be Sexy.* The words echoed in her head, over and over.

"I am yours," River sobbed as the orgasm built, a terrifying flood poised to drown her. She didn't think Candy could hear her, she was so lost in the moment. It didn't matter. A prayer was a prayer, even if her Goddess didn't hear it.

River came. The waters leapt their banks, forging a new channel in her mind.

# The Alt-Girl

## The Alt-Girl

It had only been two days since the blonde woman, Candy, had walked into the nail salon and turned River’s world upside down. Two days since River had been dragged into the waxing room and taken apart, then put back together in the shape of… of *Her.*

River stared at her reflection in the mirror of her small, cluttered apartment. The woman's voice was still bouncing around in her head. *Refresh your hair dye,* the woman had said. And River had obeyed. Her hair was now a vibrant, electric blue, the black roots gone. *Lean into the alt-girl look. Get some cute outfits*. River had spent money she didn't really have on new clothes: plaid skirts, black boots, silver jewelry.

She had sent pictures of herself wearing them to Candy, hoping for her approval. She tried to sound light, flirty, like she wasn't as obsessed as she felt. River desperately wanted to see Candy again. No, *needed* to. But Candy had a boyfriend, apparently. Of course she did. Probably a rich sugar daddy. River didn't care, she'd take Candy any way she could get her. She'd asked Candy for a threesome. It had sounded like it was going to happen, but then River's world had been shattered. The boyfriend had said no. 

Of course he had. He must know how broken River was. Surely, Candy had told him about River, told him what she had seen: a faded mess of a woman who didn't try. 

Those were the words that echoed most in River’s head. *You are going to start trying harder.* She hadn’t realized how little she was trying—how insufficient she had been—until Candy had told her.

She was trying now. River admired her new outfit in the mirror. She wore a mesh top with a corset over it, a black-and-blue plaid skirt, and chunky knee-high boots. She looked sexy. She knew it because the mirror told her so, and because the memory of Candy's voice insisted on it. *You are going to be sexy.* She focused on her chest, where the sheer fabric highlighted the curve of her breasts. She could almost swear they looked bigger, fuller than they had been. They strained against the material as if swelling to meet the new demands of her femininity. Her face looked different too. It was sultry, more alluring somehow. Maybe it was the unending need she felt coming to the surface. 

"You look great, babe," Liam said from the couch. He didn't look up from his video game. "Did you do something different with your makeup?"

River felt a spike of irritation. Liam was fine. He was *fine*. He was safe, and boring, and he touched her like he was handling groceries.

"I changed *everything*, Liam," River snapped. She walked over to the TV and stood in front of it.

He blinked, looking up, controller still in hand. "Oh. Yeah. That outfit. Man, that's a sexy outfit." He patted the cushion next to him, inviting her to sit.

River stared at him. He was soft around the edges, his t-shirt worn, his eyes tired and vacant of any real fire. But he was here.  She needed to feel it again. That surrender. That flood of intense sensation that could cut new channels in the bedrock of her soul. Maybe she didn't need *Her*. Maybe she just needed the act.

"Put the controller down," River said. Her voice was sharp.

Liam hesitated, sensing that something was wrong. "River?"

She didn't answer. She straddled his lap, pushing him back against the couch. She didn't kiss him gently; she mashed her mouth against his, grinding her hips into his crotch.

"Touch me," she commanded. "Like you own me."

"Woah, okay," Liam answered, surprised but clearly not complaining. His hands squeezed her, but he was hesitant. Careful.

 She broke the kiss and glared down at him. "No. Harder. Don't ask. Just take it."

She reached down, fumbling with his belt, undoing his jeans with frantic, jerky movements. She needed him inside her. She needed to be filled up, hoping that the sensation would plug the void in her soul where her self-worth used to be. *You are going to start trying harder*, the command echoed in her head. 

Liam helped her pull his pants off, his erection springing free. River didn't wait for foreplay. She lifted her hips and sank down onto him in one smooth motion. She wasn't wearing any panties because Candy hadn't. *Be sexy.* That's what a sexy girl should do, right? 

"Ow\!" Liam gasped, his hands coming up to hold her waist. She wasn't very wet. It hurt for her too, but that didn't matter. "River, babe, slow down."

River glared. "Don't tell me to slow down." She began to ride him, her pussy quickly lubricating itself due to the friction, if not any real arousal. She set a punishing pace and closed her eyes tight, blocking out the sight of the messy living room, the paused video game, Liam’s confused face. In her mind's eye, she tried to imagine Liam’s hands as perfectly manicured, sharp-nailed claws, his grunts as her soft, commanding purrs, and his insufficient erection as a strap-on worn by a blonde goddess.

"Pull my hair," River ordered as she bounced on him.

Liam complied, his fingers tangling in her blue bob-cut. He tugged, but it was a gentle pull, not what she needed.

"Harder\!" River screamed, impaling herself with more force. "Pull it like you hate me\! Make me feel it\!"

*Start trying harder*, the voice whispered in her mind, relentless and demanding. *Be sexy.* 

Liam jerked her head back, harder this time, startled by her intensity. "River, what has gotten into you?"

"Just fuck me\! Tell me I'm yours\! Tell me what I am\!"

Liam was moving with her now, thrusting upward, but the rhythm was all wrong. It was clumsy. It was human.

"You're... you're my girl?" Liam said, but it sounded like a question. It sounded ridiculous coming from him. There was no weight to it. No magic.

River squeezed her eyes shut tighter. It wasn't working. The physical sensation was there: the friction, the stretching. But she wasn't drowning in his lust. She wasn't submitting. She was just having rough sex on a futon with a guy who didn't realize how broken she was.

She tried to fantasize about the waxing room. The cold air. The smell of acetone. The blonde woman towering over her.

*Trust me*, the voice in her head said. *You want this.* She wanted it. But not this, not with Liam. She wanted Candy. 

River came, but it was purely mechanical. A spasm of muscles that did nothing to fill the emptiness inside. Still, it was enough for Liam to spurt inside her, and that was something. *Embrace your femininity*. What could be more feminine than having a man cum inside you? She hoped Candy would approve.

Liam wrapped his arms around her, stroking her back. "Wow," he breathed, misinterpreting her desperation for passion. "That was... intense. You really wanted me, huh?"

She didn’t, she realized. This wasn't it. He wasn't *Her*. He couldn't fill her up. He couldn't even see how empty she was.

She climbed off him, pulling her skirt down.

"River?" Liam sat up, confused by the sudden retreat. "Babe, are you okay?"

"I can't," River choked out. She felt suffocated. The apartment was too small. Liam was too small. "I can't do this."

"Can't do what? We just..."

"I need to go," River said, grabbing her purse. She needed air. She needed to find the source. She couldn't live like this.

"River, it's ten o'clock\!" Liam called after her, pulling his pants up. "Where are you going?"

"I need cigarettes," she said, slamming the door behind her. She didn't smoke. But she was starting to feel like she was burning up inside.

River fled down the cracked concrete stairs of her apartment complex and climbed into her car. It was an old sedan—the body was a faded red, clashing with the jet-black replacement hood. For River, it was just a way to get from Point A to Point B, though tonight she didn't even know where Point B was.

She pulled out her phone and typed "bar" into Google Maps. She scrolled past the family "bar and grill" type places and the dive bars that an "alt-girl" wouldn't be caught dead in. One caught her eye, it was called "Prohibition." It looked trendy. 

She pulled up 15 minutes later. There was plenty of street parking—it was a Tuesday, after all. Stepping out, she smoothed down her skirt. The night air was cool against her legs, but she barely felt it.

Inside, the atmosphere was thick and dark. Red lights cast shadows on the exposed brick walls and a slow, thumping industrial beat vibrated through the floorboards. It was mostly dead. A couple of bartenders were chatting near the taps, and a few scattered patrons nursed drinks in the booths.

River hoisted herself onto a barstool, the mesh of her top itching against her skin and ordered a drink.

A man was sitting a few stools down, hunched over a notebook, a half-finished beer next to him. He was lean, wearing a brown leather jacket over a white t-shirt, his dark hair messy in a way that took effort. Silver rings glinted on his fingers as he tapped a pen against the bar.

He looked up at River, their eyes making contact. She noticed his eyes were dark and rimmed with fatigue. Or maybe just eyeliner.

"Slow night," he said, gesturing to the mostly empty room.

"Well, it is a school night," River noted dryly.

"Yeah, true. Keeps the college crowd away. I'm Seth, by the way." He didn't extend a hand, just tilted his beer bottle toward her in a mock toast.

"I'm River," she said. She leaned forward, the corset pushing her breasts up. In the red light, her skin looked pale, almost porcelain. His eyes flicked down to her chest, then back up to her blue hair. *Be sexy*. She pushed her chest out a little further.

"River. Yeah, that fits," Seth said, his gaze lingering on her hair. "You look like you just walked out of a music video. Or a graphic novel."

"I'm trying," River said. The words tumbled out before she could stop them. "I'm trying harder." She moved to the seat next to him.

Seth raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "Harder than what? Most people here just try to look like they don't care."

River stared at him. She felt the desperate, clawing need in her gut. She couldn't do this ironic detachment. Every second spent talking was a second she wasn't being validated.

"Do you think I'm sexy?" River asked.

Seth smiled. "I mean, yeah. Obviously. You've got to know you're sexy."

River nodded. "OK," she said, coming to a decision, "Let's go."

"Go… where?" Seth asked.

"To your place."

Seth choked on his beer, a sharp cough escaping before he could cover his mouth. He wiped his lips with the back of his hand. "Woah. Are you… you serious? We haven't even finished a drink."

River picked up her drink and downed it all at once, setting it back on the counter. "I don't want a drink. I want you to take me home and fuck me."

Seth hesitated, his smile gone, replaced by a wary assessment. He looked like he was trying to figure out if she was a cop, crazy, or just trouble. "Look, River, you're hot, but you seem... I don't know. Are you okay?"

"I'm fine," River lied. "I'm just... I'm going through something. I think I just left my boyfriend. I just need this. I don't want a date. I don't want to talk about art or music or whatever you were going to hit on me with. I just want to feel it. I need to know I'm alive. That I'm good enough."

Seth looked at her for a long moment. "You're a little crazy, aren't you?"

"Maybe," River answered. "Is that a 'no'?"

"No. It's definitely not a 'no'". Another moment of hesitation. "OK, let's go." They stood up together and River followed him out to his car.

The drive was a blur of streetlights in silence. Seth drove an older model EV. He tried to make conversation once, asking where she was from, but River just stared out the window, her nails digging into her palms. She couldn't talk. Talking would break the spell. She had to stay in the headspace. She had to be ready. *Be sexy. You want this.* She wanted it so, so bad.

They arrived at a converted warehouse building. Seth lived in a loft on the third floor. It was messy in an artistic way—canvases stacked against the walls, records scattered on the floor, a mattress on a pallet in the corner.

The moment the door shut, River dove into him. She pushed him back against the wall, kissing him hard. They stumbled towards his mattress, undressing each other as they went. He was lean and wiry, but in good shape. He had the body of a cyclist or something. The most important thing was that his dick was hard. For her. 

Her outfit was harder to get out of than his. Taking off the skirt was easy, but the corset had a lot of lacing. Somehow, in the end her see-through mesh top was all that remained. He started to pull it off, but she stopped him. "No, I want to wear this," she said. "I… I need part of the outfit." *Get some cute outfits. Lean into the alt-girl look.*

"OK," he said, clearly not understanding but not wanting to ask questions anymore either. 

River lay on her back and Seth took her breasts in his hands, gently at first, kneading them through the sheer mesh of her top. She was sure they were larger than they had been last week. Was that possible? The thought was obliterated when he began sucking on them. Oh God. They were more sensitive too. He shifted, his tongue circling the nipple through the soft, thin material, and then he pulled the mesh down slightly, tearing a small rip in his haste. She reached up and ripped the top further, allowing him easy access. Seth took as much of her breast into his mouth as he could. River moaned encouragement as his tongue swirled around her nipple, the pleasure a momentary distraction from the void.

"Harder," she said. "Bite them, pull them. Oh god, just take me."

Seth obeyed, his teeth nibbling the sensitive skin. River arched her back, pushing her chest harder into Seth's mouth and ran her hands down his back. It felt so good. She didn't know it could feel this good. *You want this.* She felt his hand slide down between her thighs, felt his finger as he touched her clit, felt the electricity of it shoot through her body.

"Holy shit you're wet," he said. She was. She was so turned on. Why was she so much more turned on than she had been with Liam? They were both men, both ready to fuck her. But she knew Candy would approve of this liaison with Seth so much more. Why?

"I'm wet for you," River answered in her most sultry voice. *Be sexy. Lean into your femininity.* Of course. She shouldn't just be lying here, she needed to be as sexy as she could.

River grabbed his hair and gently pulled him away from her nipples so she could make eye contact again. She licked her lips and gave him her sexiest look. "I want you so bad. Please, put your cock inside me."

Seth nodded. "One sec, just let me grab a condom." He fished his wallet out of his pants and pulled out a wrapper. It was one of the "ribbed for her pleasure" types.

"It's OK," River said purring. "You can fuck me raw. I don't mind."

Seth hesitated. "Thanks. But I just like to be safe. I don't want a surprise in nine months, you know?" he explained as he put it on. But River knew that wasn't the only reason. She was a strange woman he'd just taken home. He was probably worried about STDs. Probably thought River was a slut. The thought just got her hotter.

Seth climbed on top of her. Unlike Liam’s hesitant approach, Seth was deliberate, his weight heavy, pressing her into the thin mattress. River wrapped her legs around him, inviting him in and he responded by sinking into her slowly and deliberately. River gasped, the sensation of his fullness feeling right, somehow. *You are going to be sexy.* Her mind repeated the mantra. *You are going to try harder.* She was trying, desperately. Was this what Candy wanted? She knew it was. Seth began to move, slow, deep, and steady. River focused on the feeling, the friction, the expression of pleasure on Seth’s face. She felt like such a slut.

"Unnnngh. Yeah, God, that's it," River said. She knew, somehow, that being a slut was important. It wasn't one of the commands Candy had given her, but it was somehow the underlying theme of them all. It was the Grand Unified Theory of her Goddess's orders. River knew this with a certainty that wasn't her own. When she had been in that waxing room, something had happened. It wasn't that Candy's mind had invaded hers, it was the opposite. River's thoughts had entered Candy's mind, but Candy's lust had been incandescent. No human mind could survive contact with that much sexual heat. River felt like her brain had been melted down and poured into a new mold to set. Her sexuality—her very being—was now Candy-shaped, somehow.

His thrusts began to pick up speed. *Refresh your hair dye. Lean into the alt-girl look.* Of course, so that men—and women—would find her sexy. *Get some cute outfits.* Outfits for people to look at her, outfits to let them know she was available. *Be sexy.* Yes, what could be sexier than fucking? 

Seth picked up the pace, kneading at her tits. "Is this what you want?" he asked, tiptoeing into some dirty talk.

"Oh yes," River moaned. "Oh god. Ungghhh. Please, tell me I'm sexy."

"Fuck, River, you're fucking gorgeous. You're the sexiest woman I've ever been with."

The words got River closer. She felt her orgasm building. She'd never been this wet before—she could feel her juices running out of her pussy, a wet spot beneath her that grew bigger with each thrust. She was so wet she wasn't getting enough friction. The ribbing on the condom helped, but what helped even more was the validation.

She needed more. "Oh God, yes. And… was my outfit cute?" 

This one caught Seth a little by surprise, but he was game. "So cute, River. You look like a manic pixie dream girl." He was going faster now. *Be sexy.* She felt her tits bouncing with each thrust. River wanted to grab them, to pinch her own nipples, but she wanted Seth to watch them more, because that meant she was being sexy. Instead she wrapped one arm beneath them, helping them bounce as he fucked her.

"Tell me I'm trying hard enough. Tell me… tell me what I am."

"God, River, I don't think you could try any harder. You're trying hard enough."

But she knew she wasn't. It didn't feel right. *You're going to start trying harder.* How could he say she was trying hard enough when Candy had said she wasn't? She wrapped her legs around him, arched her back, tried to look as sexy as possible as he fucked her. He pumped in and out faster, harder. It felt so good. But it still wasn't what she needed. 

"No, I'm not. Tell me what I am. I need to know. What I ammmmm," her sentence trailed off into moans.

"Oh God, River, I'm gonna cum. You're… I don't know. You're crazy. You're beautiful and crazy and hot and you clearly have low self-esteem."

"I know\!" she screamed, clutching at Seth's shoulders, her nails digging into his skin. "I'm broken\! I'm a broken mess\! I'm not good enough\! I'm nothing without her\!" That was it. That was the truth. She felt her pussy gripping him harder, she was so close.

"Is that what you want to hear? That you're not good enough?"

"Yes\! Just like she said\!" River yelled.

"Fine. Then you're not good enough. You're worthless," he paused, waiting for her reaction.

"I know I am, keep talking\!"

"You're a worthless slut who needs men. Who gets dressed up to go out and fuck guys because you know that's the only thing you're good for\! Is that what you want to hear, slut?"

River didn't answer with words, just an unintelligible moan that tore loose from her throat as she came, trashing wildly beneath him. She wrapped her legs around him as tight as she could, dug her fingernails into his back. She felt her pussy gripping his cock like a vise, her spasms coaxing Seth to his own climax. Seth groaned and bucked against her, and she felt his cock pulse even through the condom. 

He collapsed onto her, panting, his forehead resting on her shoulder. "You're… you're definitely *something*, River," he managed.

River shifted her position on the mattress so she wasn't lying in a puddle of her own juices and curled up next to Seth. She lay there in the afterglow, knowing she'd done something Candy would approve of. And for a moment, she thought she'd found what she needed. 

"Can I sleep here?" she asked.

"Of course," Seth said. "Yeah, of course."

She lay with him in the bed. He tried to make small talk, tried to get to know her. River did her best to seem normal, but her mind kept drifting back to *Her.* She felt the emptiness inside returning. *You are going to start trying harder,* the voice still whispered. River was beginning to worry that no matter how hard she tried, it would never be enough. The voice would always be there, pushing her. Not until Candy told her she could stop.

# Everyone Else

## Everyone Else

River woke up. There was a guy sleeping in the bed next to her, and it wasn't Liam. Or Seth, for that matter. *Try harder. Be sexy. Embrace your femininity.* What was his name again? She didn't remember. 

River had only been back to her apartment once since that night, just long enough to collect her new clothes, her toothbrush, her most important things. For the last few weeks she had been couch surfing with hookups. Trying to be feminine, to be sexy. It had been mostly guys—they were a lot easier to land than women—though River didn't have a strong preference one way or the other anymore.

She pulled out her phone and started scrolling Instagram. There was only one account she cared about. *Candice\_Cane97*. That was the handle.

Her thumb hovered over the latest photo. It was just a picture of Candy with a latte, but River stared at it like it was a religious icon. She needed to feel that feeling again. That mix of terror and absolute, blissful surrender. The feeling like their minds were merged together—that River's thoughts were water flowing into the vessel that was Candy. She took a picture of herself naked in the bed next to her latest paramour and sent it to Candy, hoping for her approval. A few minutes later, Candy "hearted" it, but nothing else. It was still something. Her Goddess's approval meant everything to her. 

There was another text from one of her old coworkers at the salon. She hadn't gotten one of those in a while. River had been friends with a few of the girls there so when she'd first stopped showing up, several of them had texted her and asked if she was OK. Those had transitioned into texts from her manager demanding updates. Finally, one saying she was fired. River didn't care. She deleted the latest message without reading it.

She decided to wake up whats-his-name with a blowjob that turned into a nice slow titfuck. After he came on her face, she took a shower and waited until he was taking his, she got dressed and left without saying goodbye. She found a thrift store and bought a t-shirt two sizes too small. It had the logo of some 80s band she'd heard of, but couldn't name a single song from. That was alt-girl, right? Candy would like it. She put it on her credit card and wore it out of the store. She really needed to do some laundry, but that could wait. *Lean into the alt-girl look. Get some cute outfits.* She checked her makeup in the mirror, and refreshed her dark lipstick. It was time to make her rounds.

River had started frequenting the places Candy tagged. A high-end coffee shop downtown. A boutique that sold clothes River could never afford. She wasn't stalking, she told herself. She was just... putting herself in the universe's path. Increasing the chance of a collision. Over the last few weeks, her search area had narrowed down. She was pretty sure it was only a matter of time.

She remembered how she used to be before Candy. Before, River had felt like she was steady. She had known who she was, even if she wasn't happy about her life. She'd hated Candy at first for her condescending tone, for telling River she needed to refresh her look. But now all River wanted was to find Candy, to get her approval. Her own self worth was nothing. It wasn't that it was low—though it was—it was that it didn't matter. It was only Candy's opinion of River that counted. *You're going to start trying harder.* 

 She walked through downtown, her boots heavy on the pavement. Before, River had hated attention. She had hidden herself in baggy hoodies and oversized flannels. She'd walked with her eyes on the pavement, headphones on blast, creating a forcefield of 'fuck off' around her. 

Now River felt the eyes on her like physical touches. Construction workers paused their drilling to watch her pass, their whistles cutting through the city noise. Instead of ignoring them, she winked. A businessman on the phone let his conversations die, his gaze dragging over the flash of skin at her waist. She blew him a kiss. Even other women looked—some with judgment, some with envy.

Every turned head was a hit of dopamine. Every lewd comment was a caress. *Embrace your femininity.* She pushed her chest out. She swayed her hips, exaggerating the movement until it felt unnatural, until it felt like *Her*. This was her new routine. She'd pick one of her admirers, eventually, and go home with him. Or her. And tomorrow she'd hit the streets again, looking for her Goddess.

She was just about to grab some dinner when she saw *Her*.

River was passing by an office building when Candy walked out, laughing at something a man in a suit was saying. She looked different, more professional, wearing a pencil skirt and a blouse that strained against her chest. But the aura was the same. That blinding, golden confidence.

River stopped dead on the sidewalk. Her heart hammered in her chest. She watched as Candy said goodbye to the suit and turned down the street, walking alone toward the parking garage.

River followed.

The hunger in her belly was a physical ache. It wasn't just sexual, though it was definitely that too. It was existential. Candy had told her who to be. Candy had given her a purpose. Without Candy telling her what to do, River didn't know who she was anymore.

She trailed half a block behind, matching Candy’s click-clack rhythm on the pavement. She watched the way Candy’s hips moved, the sway that seemed to command the air around her.

Candy turned into a parking structure. River quickened her pace. The shadows of the garage were cool and it smelled of oil and concrete. It was quiet. Perfect.

Candy was unlocking a car. River had expected something luxurious, like a white BMW. Instead it was just an old gray Kia Sorento, oddly practical and drab. It took River by surprise for a moment, and she almost missed her opportunity.

"Candy," River said. Her voice sounded wrecked, raspy, even to herself.

The blonde woman turned, startled. For a second, there was confusion in those blue eyes, and then recognition. A smile spread across her face.

"River," Candy said. "I didn't expect to see you here. I see you took my advice about the hair. It looks good."

The words were warm, validating. She needed Candy's approval so badly. "I… I've been trying," River stammered, clutching her purse strap tight enough to hurt. "Everything. The clothes, the makeup. I've been trying to be... what you said." The words tumbled out, desperate. She stepped closer. "I got fired. I haven't been home. I'm doing everything you wanted but it's not enough. Please. I need you to tell me what to do next." She was pleading now, she realized. She needed the direction, the structure, the absolute clarity that Candy had brought into her messy life.

Candy’s smile faltered, cracking to reveal something genuinely surprised, even worried. She took a small step back, closer to her car. "River, whoa. Slow down. Fired? I... I just meant you should, you know, refresh your look. Get a little confidence boost. I didn't mean for you to blow up your life." Her voice was softer than River remembered, devoid of the commanding edge. "Get a hold of yourself. What happened in the salon… that was just fun."

No. This wasn't right. Candy was supposed to take charge, to tell her what to do. Instead she was shrinking away from River, like River was the scary one and Candy was just a girl, not the Goddess River knew she was. And worse, she was telling River there was something wrong with her. *Again*. She hadn't tried hard enough, or hadn't embraced her femininity enough. She hadn't done what Candy wanted, because Candy was… afraid. River could see it in her eyes.

"This isn't right," River said, taking a step closer. She was shaking. "You… you're not just a person. You're a god or a witch or something. You changed me. I don't know how, but you did something to me. Do it again. *Please*."

Candy retreated further, making herself smaller against the car. River hadn't realized how short she was before. River had kneeled beneath Candy in the pedicure chair, lain underneath her while Candy had pushed the dildo inside her. Candy had seemed huge then, filling up the world. Now River realized she was tiny, barely over 5 feet tall. River stepped closer.

"I was just trying to help," Candy sputtered. "You were fading away, River. Now you're vibrant\!"

"I'm not vibrant, I'm hungry\!" River punched the car, her fist landing next to Candy's head and stepped closer, hemming the blonde in. "I tried, Candy. I tried with my boyfriend. I tried with a guy I met at a bar\! I tried with a girl I matched with on Tinder. None of them worked. None of them are you\!"

Candy was frozen with fear—and something else. There was a new look in her eyes, it was unmistakable. Arousal. That was what River was after, Candy's arousal, her approval. Did Candy like River taking charge? Was that what Candy had meant by "try harder?" Had River misunderstood this whole time? She reached out and grabbed Candy’s wrists, pinning them against the car door.

Candy didn't scream. She didn't fight. In fact, River felt a shudder run through the perfect woman’s body, a sudden intake of breath. 

"River," Candy breathed, "You're being aggressive."

"Is that a complaint?" River challenged. Candy's lips parted, her head tilting up towards River.

River crushed her mouth against Candy’s, a brutal, possessive kiss. Her tongue stabbed past Candy’s lips, demanding entry, forcing a deep, messy connection. Candy made a small, muffled sound. Was it a moan, a protest? River didn’t care. She intensified the pressure, grinding into the other woman’s body. *Try harder. Be sexy. You want this.* She understood now. She had to try for Candy, to take her.

She felt Candy melt. Her arms, which had been pinned, wrapped around River’s neck. A moan vibrated in Candy’s throat, a sound of surrender.

River’s hands were everywhere—groping, squeezing, desperate. She hiked up Candy’s skirt, her fingers finding the wet heat between her thighs. *Embrace your femininity.* Candy was femininity incarnate. River embraced her.

"You made me this way," River whispered against Candy’s lips. "So you have to deal with it."

"Yes," Candy gasped. "Yes, okay. Okay."

They stumbled, grappling with each other, until River pushed Candy into the backseat of the car. 

"Legs up," River ordered. Candy obeyed instantly, hooking her heels onto the edge of the seat, spreading herself wide. She wasn't wearing panties, just like in the waxing room. The sight of her—bare, slick, and waiting—sent a wave of adrenaline through River.

River didn't wait, she unbuttoned Candy's blouse and latched onto her nipple. She wasn't wearing a bra either. How did breasts that large not need a bra? River felt Candy's nipples engorging, becoming hard in her mouth. Candy cried out, her fingers tangling in River’s blue hair, arching her back off the seat.

"More," Candy begged, her voice a whine. "River, please."

River tore the blouse the rest of the way open, buttons popping and scattering onto the floor mats. She feasted on Candy’s bare skin, moving from her breasts to her stomach, leaving a trail of hot, wet kisses down the center of her torso. She gripped Candy’s hips, her fingers digging into the soft flesh, anchoring her.

When River finally buried her face between Candy’s legs, the world narrowed down to the taste of her—salt and musk and overwhelming sweetness. Candy tasted like power. *Be sexy. Embrace your femininity.* River licked broadly, flattening her tongue against the sensitive folds, savoring the way Candy’s thighs clamped around her head. 

"God, yes," Candy moaned, thrashing in the tight space. "Right there. Don't stop."

Stopping had never entered into River's mind—she was pleasing her Goddess, that was all the encouragement she needed. She pushed two fingers inside, curling them in a "come hither" motion that made Candy scream. She was relentless, attacking Candy’s pleasure with the same desperate focus she’d applied to her entire life since that day in the salon.

Candy whimpered, her hips bucking wildly, completely lost in the sensation. River increased the pace, her tongue flicking relentlessly against the swollen bud while her fingers thrust deep, claiming Candy over and over.

River needed friction. She needed to feel her own release mirrored in Candy's surrender. *Be Sexy. You want this.* The words looped in her mind endlessly. She pulled herself up into the seat with Candy, hiking up her skirt. She pressed her wet heat against Candy’s thigh, finding the perfect angle.

River ground herself against Candy’s leg, the friction sharp and immediate. She kept her rhythm on Candy perfectly steady, matching her own fingers as they pressed in and out of the object of her desire. River exulted in Candy’s cries, the wet sound of their bodies meeting, the friction building between River's legs.

"I'm close\!" Candy shrieked, her body bowing upward. Her fingers tangled in River’s blue hair, gripping tight, pulling River closer.

"Cum for me, *please,*" River half-ordered, half-begged, grinding harder, her own breath catching as she waited for the mental connection she'd felt in the wax room once more. "Do it\!"

Candy screamed as she clamped down hard on River’s fingers. The pleasure of her Goddess beneath her pushed River over the edge as well. She cried out, her body convulsing as she rode out her own orgasm against Candy’s thigh. Their mouths locked as they came. Candy embraced River, and River felt the acrylic nails she'd given to Candy digging into her skin.

River slumped forward, collapsing onto Candy’s heaving chest. She waited for the magic. She waited for that feeling of souls merging, for the golden light of the Goddess to fill her. But as their breathing slowed and the silence of the garage crept back in, River realized she was just sweating in the back of a Kia. The sex had been amazing—better than anything since the waxing room—but it had just been sex. The magic hadn't happened. 

"I don't understand," River said. "It didn't happen like last time. I *felt* you last time. Really felt you."

Candy sat up, adjusting her skirt. She stared at River, not with love, not even with lust anymore, but with pity.  

"I can't do that anymore," Candy said. "That power, it was too dangerous. I took it away from myself." She looked pointedly at River. "Clearly, that was the right call."

"I know you can. You can do anything. You're my Goddess\! Please, I need it\!"

"Your Goddess? River, you're obsessed," Candy said. It wasn't a question.

"With you\!" River hissed, reaching for her again. "I need you to tell me what to do. I need you to make me feel real. You told me to try harder. Am I trying hard enough? Am I good enough yet?"

"I have to fix this," Candy said, seemingly to herself.

"*Please*," River begged.

"YOU DON'T NEED ME," Candy said. River froze. The tone was different. It wasn't the breathless girl she had just fucked. It was the woman from the salon. The Goddess.

"You need to find someone else," Candy said, mostly to herself again. "But I don't want you to get obsessed with them either. How do I put this?"

River waited with bated breath for her new orders. This is what she wanted.

"YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL NOW. YOU ARE VIBRANT. DON'T LIMIT YOURSELF AND OBSESS OVER ONE PERSON," Candy commanded, her voice ringing in River’s skull like a bell. "THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO DESERVE YOU."

"You understand what I'm saying?" Candy continued, her voice softening, returning to normal. "There are plenty of fish in the sea, River. You don't need me."

River blinked. The frantic, desperate energy that had been focused on Candy was gone. In its place was a dawning realization. The hole she felt in her soul opened wider, becoming a vast, hungry emptiness that not even Candy could fill.

"I understand," River whispered. 

"Good," Candy said. She opened the car door. "Don't follow me again."

River got out of the car. She watched Candy drive away. She didn't feel the urge to chase her. Candy was just one person.

One person was nothing.

---

The ring light reflected in River’s eyes, two tiny halos of artificial divinity.

She was in her new apartment. It was small, dingy, and in a bad part of town but paying the deposit and first month's rent had still maxed her credit card. The walls were draped in velvet sheets. The computer setup was professional: dual monitors, a high-definition 4K webcam, a high-quality microphone on a boom arm.

River sat in a gaming chair, wearing nothing but a pair of thigh-high socks and a sheer, open robe. Her blue hair was freshly dyed, vibrant against her pale skin. Her makeup was flawless, exaggerated for the camera.

*Be sexy. Try harder. Don't limit yourself. There are lots of people out there. Be sexy. You want this.* The words echoed in her head day and night.

She glanced at the second monitor. The chat room was scrolling so fast it was a blur of text and emotes. The viewer count in the corner ticked upward.

*1,403 viewers.*

A shiver of pure ecstasy ran down River’s spine. It was better than sex. It was better than the waxing room. It was a thousand pairs of eyes, all fixed on her. A thousand minds, all thinking about her. They all deserved her. There were so many people in the world who did.

"Hey guys," River purred into the microphone, her voice dropping to that sultry register she had perfected. "Thanks for the tokens, BigDaddy69. I see you."

She leaned forward, letting the robe slip a fraction of an inch. The viewer count jumped again.

*1,532.*

She felt the collective gaze like a physical weight, a warm blanket of approval wrapping around her. There was still an emptiness inside her, but she was filling it up, one like and comment at a time. She was a creature of the lens now. She only existed when she was on someone's screen.

River smiled at the camera, a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes.

"Who wants to tell me what to do next?" she asked the invisible ocean of strangers. "I'm yours. All of you."

The goal bar at the top of the screen filled up. They'd hit 5,000 tokens, and that meant her web-connected vibrator came on. She moaned, writhed on it, played it up for the audience.

But what really mattered were the views. She'd thought it was Candy's approval she needed, but now she knew the truth. It was *everyone's*.

The view count hit 2,000. She started to cum, for real this time.
