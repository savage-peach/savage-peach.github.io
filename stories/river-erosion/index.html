<strong>Author's Note</strong>
<p>This story is in the same universe as <a href='../../stories/using-master-pc/index.html'>Using Master PC For Self-Improvement</a> and, in fact, Part 1 is a retelling of one chapter from it. There is no correct order to read the two in, but if you read this first and want to know Candy’s backstory, then perhaps it should be your next stop.</p>
