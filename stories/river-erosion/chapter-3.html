<p>River woke up. There was a guy sleeping in the bed next to her, and it wasn’t Liam. Or Seth, for that matter. <em>Try harder. Be sexy. Embrace your femininity.</em> What was his name again? She didn’t remember. </p>
<p>River had only been back to her apartment once since that night, just long enough to collect her new clothes, her toothbrush, her most important things. For the last few weeks she had been couch surfing with hookups. Trying to be feminine, to be sexy. It had been mostly guys—they were a lot easier to land than women—though River didn’t have a strong preference one way or the other anymore.</p>
<p>She pulled out her phone and started scrolling Instagram. There was only one account she cared about. <em>Candice_Cane97</em>. That was the handle.</p>
<p>Her thumb hovered over the latest photo. It was just a picture of Candy with a latte, but River stared at it like it was a religious icon. She needed to feel that feeling again. That mix of terror and absolute, blissful surrender. The feeling like their minds were merged together—that River’s thoughts were water flowing into the vessel that was Candy. She took a picture of herself naked in the bed next to her latest paramour and sent it to Candy, hoping for her approval. A few minutes later, Candy “hearted” it, but nothing else. It was still something. Her Goddess’s approval meant everything to her. </p>
<p>There was another text from one of her old coworkers at the salon. She hadn’t gotten one of those in a while. River had been friends with a few of the girls there so when she’d first stopped showing up, several of them had texted her and asked if she was OK. Those had transitioned into texts from her manager demanding updates. Finally, one saying she was fired. River didn’t care. She deleted the latest message without reading it.</p>
<p>She decided to wake up whats-his-name with a blowjob that turned into a nice slow titfuck. After he came on her face, she took a shower and waited until he was taking his, she got dressed and left without saying goodbye. She found a thrift store and bought a t-shirt two sizes too small. It had the logo of some 80s band she’d heard of, but couldn’t name a single song from. That was alt-girl, right? Candy would like it. She put it on her credit card and wore it out of the store. She really needed to do some laundry, but that could wait. <em>Lean into the alt-girl look. Get some cute outfits.</em> She checked her makeup in the mirror, and refreshed her dark lipstick. It was time to make her rounds.</p>
<p>River had started frequenting the places Candy tagged. A high-end coffee shop downtown. A boutique that sold clothes River could never afford. She wasn’t stalking, she told herself. She was just… putting herself in the universe’s path. Increasing the chance of a collision. Over the last few weeks, her search area had narrowed down. She was pretty sure it was only a matter of time.</p>
<p>She remembered how she used to be before Candy. Before, River had felt like she was steady. She had known who she was, even if she wasn’t happy about her life. She’d hated Candy at first for her condescending tone, for telling River she needed to refresh her look. But now all River wanted was to find Candy, to get her approval. Her own self worth was nothing. It wasn’t that it was low—though it was—it was that it didn’t matter. It was only Candy’s opinion of River that counted. <em>You’re going to start trying harder.</em> </p>
<p>She walked through downtown, her boots heavy on the pavement. Before, River had hated attention. She had hidden herself in baggy hoodies and oversized flannels. She’d walked with her eyes on the pavement, headphones on blast, creating a forcefield of ‘fuck off’ around her. </p>
<p>Now River felt the eyes on her like physical touches. Construction workers paused their drilling to watch her pass, their whistles cutting through the city noise. Instead of ignoring them, she winked. A businessman on the phone let his conversations die, his gaze dragging over the flash of skin at her waist. She blew him a kiss. Even other women looked—some with judgment, some with envy.</p>
<p>Every turned head was a hit of dopamine. Every lewd comment was a caress. <em>Embrace your femininity.</em> She pushed her chest out. She swayed her hips, exaggerating the movement until it felt unnatural, until it felt like <em>Her</em>. This was her new routine. She’d pick one of her admirers, eventually, and go home with him. Or her. And tomorrow she’d hit the streets again, looking for her Goddess.</p>
<p>She was just about to grab some dinner when she saw <em>Her</em>.</p>
<p>River was passing by an office building when Candy walked out, laughing at something a man in a suit was saying. She looked different, more professional, wearing a pencil skirt and a blouse that strained against her chest. But the aura was the same. That blinding, golden confidence.</p>
<p>River stopped dead on the sidewalk. Her heart hammered in her chest. She watched as Candy said goodbye to the suit and turned down the street, walking alone toward the parking garage.</p>
<p>River followed.</p>
<p>The hunger in her belly was a physical ache. It wasn’t just sexual, though it was definitely that too. It was existential. Candy had told her who to be. Candy had given her a purpose. Without Candy telling her what to do, River didn’t know who she was anymore.</p>
<p>She trailed half a block behind, matching Candy’s click-clack rhythm on the pavement. She watched the way Candy’s hips moved, the sway that seemed to command the air around her.</p>
<p>Candy turned into a parking structure. River quickened her pace. The shadows of the garage were cool and it smelled of oil and concrete. It was quiet. Perfect.</p>
<p>Candy was unlocking a car. River had expected something luxurious, like a white BMW. Instead it was just an old gray Kia Sorento, oddly practical and drab. It took River by surprise for a moment, and she almost missed her opportunity.</p>
<p>“Candy,” River said. Her voice sounded wrecked, raspy, even to herself.</p>
<p>The blonde woman turned, startled. For a second, there was confusion in those blue eyes, and then recognition. A smile spread across her face.</p>
<p>“River,” Candy said. “I didn’t expect to see you here. I see you took my advice about the hair. It looks good.”</p>
<p>The words were warm, validating. She needed Candy’s approval so badly. “I… I’ve been trying,” River stammered, clutching her purse strap tight enough to hurt. “Everything. The clothes, the makeup. I’ve been trying to be… what you said.” The words tumbled out, desperate. She stepped closer. “I got fired. I haven’t been home. I’m doing everything you wanted but it’s not enough. Please. I need you to tell me what to do next.” She was pleading now, she realized. She needed the direction, the structure, the absolute clarity that Candy had brought into her messy life.</p>
<p>Candy’s smile faltered, cracking to reveal something genuinely surprised, even worried. She took a small step back, closer to her car. “River, whoa. Slow down. Fired? I… I just meant you should, you know, refresh your look. Get a little confidence boost. I didn’t mean for you to blow up your life.” Her voice was softer than River remembered, devoid of the commanding edge. “Get a hold of yourself. What happened in the salon… that was just fun.”</p>
<p>No. This wasn’t right. Candy was supposed to take charge, to tell her what to do. Instead she was shrinking away from River, like River was the scary one and Candy was just a girl, not the Goddess River knew she was. And worse, she was telling River there was something wrong with her. <em>Again</em>. She hadn’t tried hard enough, or hadn’t embraced her femininity enough. She hadn’t done what Candy wanted, because Candy was… afraid. River could see it in her eyes.</p>
<p>“This isn’t right,” River said, taking a step closer. She was shaking. “You… you’re not just a person. You’re a god or a witch or something. You changed me. I don’t know how, but you did something to me. Do it again. <em>Please</em>.”</p>
<p>Candy retreated further, making herself smaller against the car. River hadn’t realized how short she was before. River had kneeled beneath Candy in the pedicure chair, lain underneath her while Candy had pushed the dildo inside her. Candy had seemed huge then, filling up the world. Now River realized she was tiny, barely over 5 feet tall. River stepped closer.</p>
<p>“I was just trying to help,” Candy sputtered. “You were fading away, River. Now you’re vibrant!“</p>
<p>“I’m not vibrant, I’m hungry!” River punched the car, her fist landing next to Candy’s head and stepped closer, hemming the blonde in. “I tried, Candy. I tried with my boyfriend. I tried with a guy I met at a bar! I tried with a girl I matched with on Tinder. None of them worked. None of them are you!“</p>
<p>Candy was frozen with fear—and something else. There was a new look in her eyes, it was unmistakable. Arousal. That was what River was after, Candy’s arousal, her approval. Did Candy like River taking charge? Was that what Candy had meant by “try harder?” Had River misunderstood this whole time? She reached out and grabbed Candy’s wrists, pinning them against the car door.</p>
<p>Candy didn’t scream. She didn’t fight. In fact, River felt a shudder run through the perfect woman’s body, a sudden intake of breath. </p>
<p>“River,” Candy breathed, “You’re being aggressive.”</p>
<p>“Is that a complaint?” River challenged. Candy’s lips parted, her head tilting up towards River.</p>
<p>River crushed her mouth against Candy’s, a brutal, possessive kiss. Her tongue stabbed past Candy’s lips, demanding entry, forcing a deep, messy connection. Candy made a small, muffled sound. Was it a moan, a protest? River didn’t care. She intensified the pressure, grinding into the other woman’s body. <em>Try harder. Be sexy. You want this.</em> She understood now. She had to try for Candy, to take her.</p>
<p>She felt Candy melt. Her arms, which had been pinned, wrapped around River’s neck. A moan vibrated in Candy’s throat, a sound of surrender.</p>
<p>River’s hands were everywhere—groping, squeezing, desperate. She hiked up Candy’s skirt, her fingers finding the wet heat between her thighs. <em>Embrace your femininity.</em> Candy was femininity incarnate. River embraced her.</p>
<p>“You made me this way,” River whispered against Candy’s lips. “So you have to deal with it.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Candy gasped. “Yes, okay. Okay.”</p>
<p>They stumbled, grappling with each other, until River pushed Candy into the backseat of the car. </p>
<p>“Legs up,” River ordered. Candy obeyed instantly, hooking her heels onto the edge of the seat, spreading herself wide. She wasn’t wearing panties, just like in the waxing room. The sight of her—bare, slick, and waiting—sent a wave of adrenaline through River.</p>
<p>River didn’t wait, she unbuttoned Candy’s blouse and latched onto her nipple. She wasn’t wearing a bra either. How did breasts that large not need a bra? River felt Candy’s nipples engorging, becoming hard in her mouth. Candy cried out, her fingers tangling in River’s blue hair, arching her back off the seat.</p>
<p>“More,” Candy begged, her voice a whine. “River, please.”</p>
<p>River tore the blouse the rest of the way open, buttons popping and scattering onto the floor mats. She feasted on Candy’s bare skin, moving from her breasts to her stomach, leaving a trail of hot, wet kisses down the center of her torso. She gripped Candy’s hips, her fingers digging into the soft flesh, anchoring her.</p>
<p>When River finally buried her face between Candy’s legs, the world narrowed down to the taste of her—salt and musk and overwhelming sweetness. Candy tasted like power. <em>Be sexy. Embrace your femininity.</em> River licked broadly, flattening her tongue against the sensitive folds, savoring the way Candy’s thighs clamped around her head. </p>
<p>“God, yes,” Candy moaned, thrashing in the tight space. “Right there. Don’t stop.”</p>
<p>Stopping had never entered into River’s mind—she was pleasing her Goddess, that was all the encouragement she needed. She pushed two fingers inside, curling them in a “come hither” motion that made Candy scream. She was relentless, attacking Candy’s pleasure with the same desperate focus she’d applied to her entire life since that day in the salon.</p>
<p>Candy whimpered, her hips bucking wildly, completely lost in the sensation. River increased the pace, her tongue flicking relentlessly against the swollen bud while her fingers thrust deep, claiming Candy over and over.</p>
<p>River needed friction. She needed to feel her own release mirrored in Candy’s surrender. <em>Be Sexy. You want this.</em> The words looped in her mind endlessly. She pulled herself up into the seat with Candy, hiking up her skirt. She pressed her wet heat against Candy’s thigh, finding the perfect angle.</p>
<p>River ground herself against Candy’s leg, the friction sharp and immediate. She kept her rhythm on Candy perfectly steady, matching her own fingers as they pressed in and out of the object of her desire. River exulted in Candy’s cries, the wet sound of their bodies meeting, the friction building between River’s legs.</p>
<p>“I’m close!” Candy shrieked, her body bowing upward. Her fingers tangled in River’s blue hair, gripping tight, pulling River closer.</p>
<p>“Cum for me, <em>please,</em>” River half-ordered, half-begged, grinding harder, her own breath catching as she waited for the mental connection she’d felt in the wax room once more. “Do it!“</p>
<p>Candy screamed as she clamped down hard on River’s fingers. The pleasure of her Goddess beneath her pushed River over the edge as well. She cried out, her body convulsing as she rode out her own orgasm against Candy’s thigh. Their mouths locked as they came. Candy embraced River, and River felt the acrylic nails she’d given to Candy digging into her skin.</p>
<p>River slumped forward, collapsing onto Candy’s heaving chest. She waited for the magic. She waited for that feeling of souls merging, for the golden light of the Goddess to fill her. But as their breathing slowed and the silence of the garage crept back in, River realized she was just sweating in the back of a Kia. The sex had been amazing—better than anything since the waxing room—but it had just been sex. The magic hadn’t happened. </p>
<p>“I don’t understand,” River said. “It didn’t happen like last time. I <em>felt</em> you last time. Really felt you.”</p>
<p>Candy sat up, adjusting her skirt. She stared at River, not with love, not even with lust anymore, but with pity.  </p>
<p>“I can’t do that anymore,” Candy said. “That power, it was too dangerous. I took it away from myself.” She looked pointedly at River. “Clearly, that was the right call.”</p>
<p>“I know you can. You can do anything. You’re my Goddess! Please, I need it!“</p>
<p>“Your Goddess? River, you’re obsessed,” Candy said. It wasn’t a question.</p>
<p>“With you!” River hissed, reaching for her again. “I need you to tell me what to do. I need you to make me feel real. You told me to try harder. Am I trying hard enough? Am I good enough yet?”</p>
<p>“I have to fix this,” Candy said, seemingly to herself.</p>
<p>“<em>Please</em>,” River begged.</p>
<p>“YOU DON’T NEED ME,” Candy said. River froze. The tone was different. It wasn’t the breathless girl she had just fucked. It was the woman from the salon. The Goddess.</p>
<p>“You need to find someone else,” Candy said, mostly to herself again. “But I don’t want you to get obsessed with them either. How do I put this?”</p>
<p>River waited with bated breath for her new orders. This is what she wanted.</p>
<p>“YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL NOW. YOU ARE VIBRANT. DON’T LIMIT YOURSELF AND OBSESS OVER ONE PERSON,” Candy commanded, her voice ringing in River’s skull like a bell. “THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO DESERVE YOU.”</p>
<p>“You understand what I’m saying?” Candy continued, her voice softening, returning to normal. “There are plenty of fish in the sea, River. You don’t need me.”</p>
<p>River blinked. The frantic, desperate energy that had been focused on Candy was gone. In its place was a dawning realization. The hole she felt in her soul opened wider, becoming a vast, hungry emptiness that not even Candy could fill.</p>
<p>“I understand,” River whispered. </p>
<p>“Good,” Candy said. She opened the car door. “Don’t follow me again.”</p>
<p>River got out of the car. She watched Candy drive away. She didn’t feel the urge to chase her. Candy was just one person.</p>
<p>One person was nothing.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The ring light reflected in River’s eyes, two tiny halos of artificial divinity.</p>
<p>She was in her new apartment. It was small, dingy, and in a bad part of town but paying the deposit and first month’s rent had still maxed her credit card. The walls were draped in velvet sheets. The computer setup was professional: dual monitors, a high-definition 4K webcam, a high-quality microphone on a boom arm.</p>
<p>River sat in a gaming chair, wearing nothing but a pair of thigh-high socks and a sheer, open robe. Her blue hair was freshly dyed, vibrant against her pale skin. Her makeup was flawless, exaggerated for the camera.</p>
<p><em>Be sexy. Try harder. Don’t limit yourself. There are lots of people out there. Be sexy. You want this.</em> The words echoed in her head day and night.</p>
<p>She glanced at the second monitor. The chat room was scrolling so fast it was a blur of text and emotes. The viewer count in the corner ticked upward.</p>
<p><em>1,403 viewers.</em></p>
<p>A shiver of pure ecstasy ran down River’s spine. It was better than sex. It was better than the waxing room. It was a thousand pairs of eyes, all fixed on her. A thousand minds, all thinking about her. They all deserved her. There were so many people in the world who did.</p>
<p>“Hey guys,” River purred into the microphone, her voice dropping to that sultry register she had perfected. “Thanks for the tokens, BigDaddy69. I see you.”</p>
<p>She leaned forward, letting the robe slip a fraction of an inch. The viewer count jumped again.</p>
<p><em>1,532.</em></p>
<p>She felt the collective gaze like a physical weight, a warm blanket of approval wrapping around her. There was still an emptiness inside her, but she was filling it up, one like and comment at a time. She was a creature of the lens now. She only existed when she was on someone’s screen.</p>
<p>River smiled at the camera, a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes.</p>
<p>“Who wants to tell me what to do next?” she asked the invisible ocean of strangers. “I’m yours. All of you.”</p>
<p>The goal bar at the top of the screen filled up. They’d hit 5,000 tokens, and that meant her web-connected vibrator came on. She moaned, writhed on it, played it up for the audience.</p>
<p>But what really mattered were the views. She’d thought it was Candy’s approval she needed, but now she knew the truth. It was <em>everyone’s</em>.</p>
<p>The view count hit 2,000. She started to cum, for real this time. </p>
